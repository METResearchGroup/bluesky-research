# Update Bluesky mute lists

Bluesky has [lists](https://docs.bsky.app/docs/tutorials/user-lists), which are lists of users. People can build lists of users for certain purposes (e.g., users who post about sports, users named "Jake", etc.). Bluesky has a system of ["stackable moderation"](https://bsky.social/about/blog/03-12-2024-stackable-moderation) and many users actively curate and maintain lists of users who, for example, post spam or NSFW content. We can subscribe to these community-curated lists in order to get the lists of users whose content we will likely want to filter out.
