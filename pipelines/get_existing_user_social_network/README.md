# Get Existing User Social Network

This pipeline fetches the social network for users using the Bluesky API. This works in conjunction with the "add_users_to_study" pipeline (see that README for more details).

The setup of this pipeline resembles a Rust project because this was also an experiment in using the [`uv` package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/).
