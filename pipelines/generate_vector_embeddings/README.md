# Generate Vector Embeddings

This pipeline generates vector embeddings for posts. It was intended to initially do a naive vector similarity search in order to generate posts similar to those previously liked by a user. This currently isn't being run in production, but will likely be revisited when developing, for example, a two-tower network, as the embeddings started here will be useful later on.
