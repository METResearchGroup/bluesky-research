For example, the text in a post might comment on an image or on a retweeted post. Attend to the context where appropriate. Here is some context on the post that needs classification: ```\n<Thread that the post is a part of>\n \nThe post is a reply to another post with the following details:\n```\n[text]: Let me pre-register: as of right now, this date, with the full knowledge that a lot can happen\u2014DJT has vastly more loser energy than in 2016 or 2020, and it\u2019s not just because he has, well, lost\u2014he\u2019s whiny and self-centered in a new, more insular fashion \n```\n\n\n```\nAgain, the text of the post that needs to be classified is:\n```\n<text>\nhis campaign is literally just \u201cwoe is me I am the most persecuted man in the history of the world\u201d\n\nthat\u2019s it, that\u2019s all he\u2019s got, and the fact that the Times and company keep pretending there\u2019s a coherent policy stance other than revenge is infuriating\n```\n\nJustifications are not necessary.\nReturn ONLY the JSON.

Civic refers to whether a given post is related to politics (government, elections, politicians, activism, etc.) or social issues (major issues that affect a large group of people, such as the economy, inequality, racism, education, immigration, human rights, the environment, etc.). We refer to any content that is classified as being either of these two categories as \u201ccivic\u201d; otherwise they are not civic. Please classify the following text denoted in <text> as \"civic\" or \"not civic\". \n\nThen, if the post is civic, classify the text based on the political lean of the opinion or argument it presents. Your options are 'left-leaning', 'moderate', 'right-leaning', or 'unclear'. You are analyzing text that has been pre-identified as 'political' in nature. If the text is not civic, return \"unclear\".\n\nThink through your response step by step.\n\nReturn in a JSON format in the following way:\n{\n    \"civic\": <two values, 'civic' or 'not civic'>,\n    \"political_ideology\": <four values, 'left-leaning', 'moderate', 'right-leaning', 'unclear'>,\n    \"reason_civic\": <optional, a 1 sentence reason for why the text is civic>,\n    \"reason_political_ideology\": <optional, a 1 sentence reason for why the text has the given political ideology>\n}\n\n\nHere is the post text that needs to be classified:\n```\n<text>\nmuch of the general public\u2019s idea of the man is fixed on hazy memories of him being kind of a dick with a good stock market and then writing off Covid as \u201cwow that sucked\u201d\n\nhe is far, far worse than he was in 2020 and the result this fall will depend largely on how much folks understand that\n```\n\n\nThe classification of a post might depend on contextual information. For example, the text in a post might comment on an image or on a retweeted post. Attend to the context where appropriate. Here is some context on the post that needs classification: ```\n<Content referenced or linked to in the post>\n \nThe post references another post with the following details:\n```\n\n[embedded record text]: One\u2026 difficulty, error, whatever you want to call it\u2026 in both coverage and perceptions is that Trump\u2019s a kind of fixed constant.
