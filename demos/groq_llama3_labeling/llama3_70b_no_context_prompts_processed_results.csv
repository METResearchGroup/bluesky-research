Pretend that you are a classifier that predicts whether a post has civic content or not. Civic refers to whether a given post is related to politics (government, elections, politicians, activism, etc.) or social issues (major issues that affect a large group of people, such as the economy, inequality, racism, education, immigration, human rights, the environment, etc.). We refer to any content that is classified as being either of these two categories as “civic”; otherwise they are not civic. Please classify the following text denoted in <text> as ""civic"" or ""not civic"". 

Then, if the post is civic, classify the text based on the political lean of the opinion or argument it presents. Your options are 'left-leaning', 'moderate', 'right-leaning', or 'unclear'. You are analyzing text that has been pre-identified as 'political' in nature. If the text is not civic, return ""unclear"".

Pretend that you are a classifier that predicts whether a post has civic content or not. Civic refers to whether a given post is related to politics (government, elections, politicians, activism, etc.) or social issues (major issues that affect a large group of people, such as the economy, inequality, racism, education, immigration, human rights, the environment, etc.). We refer to any content that is classified as being either of these two categories as “civic”; otherwise they are not civic. Please classify the following text denoted in <text> as ""civic"" or ""not civic"". 

Then, if the post is civic, classify the text based on the political lean of the opinion or argument it presents. Your options are 'left-leaning', 'moderate', 'right-leaning', or 'unclear'. You are analyzing text that has been pre-identified as 'political' in nature. If the text is not civic, return ""unclear"".

Fresh results from another basic income pilot. This one took place in San Antonio, Texas where 1,000 people got a $1,908 payment in Dec 2020, followed by 8 quarterly $400 payments between Apr 2021 and Jan 2023.

What happened?

Incomes from work went up.

That's a commonly observed impact BTW.

Civic refers to whether a given post is related to politics (government, elections, politicians, activism, etc.) or social issues (major issues that affect a large group of people, such as the economy, inequality, racism, education, immigration, human rights, the environment, etc.). We refer to any content that is classified as being either of these two categories as “civic”; otherwise they are not civic. Please classify the following text denoted in <text> as ""civic"" or ""not civic"".

Pretend that you are a classifier that predicts whether a post has civic content or not. Civic refers to whether a given post is related to politics (government, elections, politicians, activism, etc.) or social issues (major issues that affect a large group of people, such as the economy, inequality, racism, education, immigration, human rights, the environment, etc.). We refer to any content that is classified as being either of these two categories as “civic”; otherwise they are not civic. Please classify the following text denoted in <text> as ""civic"" or ""not civic"". 

Then, if the post is civic, classify the text based on the political lean of the opinion or argument it presents. Your options are 'left-leaning', 'moderate', 'right-leaning', or 'unclear'. You are analyzing text that has been pre-identified as 'political' in nature. If the text is not civic, return ""unclear"".

Civic refers to whether a given post is related to politics (government, elections, politicians, activism, etc.) or social issues (major issues that affect a large group of people, such as the economy, inequality, racism, education, immigration, human rights, the environment, etc.). We refer to any content that is classified as being either of these two categories as “civic”; otherwise they are not civic. Please classify the following text denoted in <text> as ""civic"" or ""not civic"". 

Then, if the post is civic, classify the text based on the political lean of the opinion or argument it presents. Your options are 'left-leaning', 'moderate', 'right-leaning', or 'unclear'. You are analyzing text that has been pre-identified as 'political' in nature. If the text is not civic, return ""unclear"".

Pretend that you are a classifier that predicts whether a post has civic content or not. Civic refers to whether a given post is related to politics (government, elections, politicians, activism, etc.) or social issues (major issues that affect a large group of people, such as the economy, inequality, racism, education, immigration, human rights, the environment, etc.). We refer to any content that is classified as being either of these two categories as “civic”; otherwise they are not civic. Please classify the following text denoted in <text> as ""civic"" or ""not civic"". 

Then, if the post is civic, classify the text based on the political lean of the opinion or argument it presents. Your options are 'left-leaning', 'moderate', 'right-leaning', or 'unclear'. You are analyzing text that has been pre-identified as 'political' in nature. If the text is not civic, return ""unclear"".

Hey, remember MOOCs? Remember ""the year of the MOOC?"" Remember how UVA's board tried to fire the president because she wasn't sufficiently hyped about MOOCs? Remember how Sebastian Thrun (Udacity) said there would eventually be only 10 higher-ed outlets bc of MOOCs?

Pretend that you are a classifier that predicts whether a post has civic content or not. Civic refers to whether a given post is related to politics (government, elections, politicians, activism, etc.) or social issues (major issues that affect a large group of people, such as the economy, inequality, racism, education, immigration, human rights, the environment, etc.). We refer to any content that is classified as being either of these two categories as “civic”; otherwise they are not civic. Please classify the following text denoted in <text> as ""civic"" or ""not civic"". 

Then, if the post is civic, classify the text based on the political lean of the opinion or argument it presents. Your options are 'left-leaning', 'moderate', 'right-leaning', or 'unclear'. You are analyzing text that has been pre-identified as 'political' in nature. If the text is not civic, return ""unclear"".

Civic refers to whether a given post is related to politics (government, elections, politicians, activism, etc.) or social issues (major issues that affect a large group of people, such as the economy, inequality, racism, education, immigration, human rights, the environment, etc.). We refer to any content that is classified as being either of these two categories as “civic”; otherwise they are not civic. Please classify the following text denoted in <text> as ""civic"" or ""not civic"". 

Then, if the post is civic, classify the text based on the political lean of the opinion or argument it presents. Your options are 'left-leaning', 'moderate', 'right-leaning', or 'unclear'. You are analyzing text that has been pre-identified as 'political' in nature. If the text is not civic, return ""unclear"".

Pretend that you are a classifier that predicts whether a post has civic content or not. Civic refers to whether a given post is related to politics (government, elections, politicians, activism, etc.) or social issues (major issues that affect a large group of people, such as the economy, inequality, racism, education, immigration, human rights, the environment, etc.). We refer to any content that is classified as being either of these two categories as “civic”; otherwise they are not civic. Please classify the following text denoted in <text> as ""civic"" or ""not civic"". 

Then, if the post is civic, classify the text based on the political lean of the opinion or argument it presents. Your options are 'left-leaning', 'moderate', 'right-leaning', or 'unclear'. You are analyzing text that has been pre-identified as 'political' in nature. If the text is not civic, return ""unclear"".

Civic refers to whether a given post is related to politics (government, elections, politicians, activism, etc.) or social issues (major issues that affect a large group of people, such as the economy, inequality, racism, education, immigration, human rights, the environment, etc.). We refer to any content that is classified as being either of these two categories as “civic”; otherwise they are not civic. Please classify the following text denoted in <text> as ""civic"" or ""not civic"". 

Then, if the post is civic, classify the text based on the political lean of the opinion or argument it presents. Your options are 'left-leaning', 'moderate', 'right-leaning', or 'unclear'. You are analyzing text that has been pre-identified as 'political' in nature. If the text is not civic, return ""unclear"".

Pretend that you are a classifier that predicts whether a post has civic content or not. Civic refers to whether a given post is related to politics (government, elections, politicians, activism, etc.) or social issues (major issues that affect a large group of people, such as the economy, inequality, racism, education, immigration, human rights, the environment, etc.). We refer to any content that is classified as being either of these two categories as “civic”; otherwise they are not civic. Please classify the following text denoted in <text> as ""civic"" or ""not civic"". 

Then, if the post is civic, classify the text based on the political lean of the opinion or argument it presents. Your options are 'left-leaning', 'moderate', 'right-leaning', or 'unclear'. You are analyzing text that has been pre-identified as 'political' in nature. If the text is not civic, return ""unclear"".

Pretend that you are a classifier that predicts whether a post has civic content or not. Civic refers to whether a given post is related to politics (government, elections, politicians, activism, etc.) or social issues (major issues that affect a large group of people, such as the economy, inequality, racism, education, immigration, human rights, the environment, etc.). We refer to any content that is classified as being either of these two categories as “civic”; otherwise they are not civic. Please classify the following text denoted in <text> as ""civic"" or ""not civic"". 

Then, if the post is civic, classify the text based on the political lean of the opinion or argument it presents. Your options are 'left-leaning', 'moderate', 'right-leaning', or 'unclear'. You are analyzing text that has been pre-identified as 'political' in nature. If the text is not civic, return ""unclear"".

Civic refers to whether a given post is related to politics (government, elections, politicians, activism, etc.) or social issues (major issues that affect a large group of people, such as the economy, inequality, racism, education, immigration, human rights, the environment, etc.). We refer to any content that is classified as being either of these two categories as “civic”; otherwise they are not civic. Please classify the following text denoted in <text> as ""civic"" or ""not civic"". 

Then, if the post is civic, classify the text based on the political lean of the opinion or argument it presents. Your options are 'left-leaning', 'moderate', 'right-leaning', or 'unclear'. You are analyzing text that has been pre-identified as 'political' in nature. If the text is not civic, return ""unclear"".

Think through your response step by step.

Return in a JSON format in the following way:

Civic refers to whether a given post is related to politics (government, elections, politicians, activism, etc.) or social issues (major issues that affect a large group of people, such as the economy, inequality, racism, education, immigration, human rights, the environment, etc.). We refer to any content that is classified as being either of these two categories as “civic”; otherwise they are not civic. Please classify the following text denoted in <text> as ""civic"" or ""not civic"". 

Then, if the post is civic, classify the text based on the political lean of the opinion or argument it presents. Your options are 'left-leaning', 'moderate', 'right-leaning', or 'unclear'. You are analyzing text that has been pre-identified as 'political' in nature. If the text is not civic, return ""unclear"".

Pretend that you are a classifier that predicts whether a post has civic content or not. Civic refers to whether a given post is related to politics (government, elections, politicians, activism, etc.) or social issues (major issues that affect a large group of people, such as the economy, inequality, racism, education, immigration, human rights, the environment, etc.). We refer to any content that is classified as being either of these two categories as “civic”; otherwise they are not civic. Please classify the following text denoted in <text> as ""civic"" or ""not civic"". 

Then, if the post is civic, classify the text based on the political lean of the opinion or argument it presents. Your options are 'left-leaning', 'moderate', 'right-leaning', or 'unclear'. You are analyzing text that has been pre-identified as 'political' in nature. If the text is not civic, return ""unclear"".

much of the general public’s idea of the man is fixed on hazy memories of him being kind of a dick with a good stock market and then writing off Covid as “wow that sucked”
