Pretend that you are a classifier that predicts whether a post has civic content or not. Civic refers to whether a given post is related to politics (government, elections, politicians, activism, etc.) or social issues (major issues that affect a large group of people, such as the economy, inequality, racism, education, immigration, human rights, the environment, etc.). We refer to any content that is classified as being either of these two categories as “civic”; otherwise they are not civic. Please classify the following text denoted in <text> as ""civic"" or ""not civic"". 

Then, if the post is civic, classify the text based on the political lean of the opinion or argument it presents. Your options are 'left-leaning', 'moderate', 'right-leaning', or 'unclear'. You are analyzing text that has been pre-identified as 'political' in nature. If the text is not civic, return ""unclear"".

Think through your response step by step.

Abusive officers were rarely related to the children they were accused of raping, fondling and exploiting. They most frequently targeted girls who were 13 to 15 years old — and regularly met their victims through their jobs.

Pretend that you are a classifier that predicts whether a post has civic content or not. Civic refers to whether a given post is related to politics (government, elections, politicians, activism, etc.) or social issues (major issues that affect a large group of people, such as the economy, inequality, racism, education, immigration, human rights, the environment, etc.). We refer to any content that is classified as being either of these two categories as “civic”; otherwise they are not civic. Please classify the following text denoted in <text> as ""civic"" or ""not civic"". 

Then, if the post is civic, classify the text based on the political lean of the opinion or argument it presents. Your options are 'left-leaning', 'moderate', 'right-leaning', or 'unclear'. You are analyzing text that has been pre-identified as 'political' in nature. If the text is not civic, return ""unclear"".

Civic refers to whether a given post is related to politics (government, elections, politicians, activism, etc.) or social issues (major issues that affect a large group of people, such as the economy, inequality, racism, education, immigration, human rights, the environment, etc.). We refer to any content that is classified as being either of these two categories as “civic”; otherwise they are not civic. Please classify the following text denoted in <text> as ""civic"" or ""not civic"". 

Then, if the post is civic, classify the text based on the political lean of the opinion or argument it presents. Your options are 'left-leaning', 'moderate', 'right-leaning', or 'unclear'. You are analyzing text that has been pre-identified as 'political' in nature. If the text is not civic, return ""unclear"".

Think through your response step by step.

Return in a JSON format in the following way:

Pretend that you are a classifier that predicts whether a post has civic content or not. Civic refers to whether a given post is related to politics (government, elections, politicians, activism, etc.) or social issues (major issues that affect a large group of people, such as the economy, inequality, racism, education, immigration, human rights, the environment, etc.). We refer to any content that is classified as being either of these two categories as “civic”; otherwise they are not civic. Please classify the following text denoted in <text> as ""civic"" or ""not civic"". 

Then, if the post is civic, classify the text based on the political lean of the opinion or argument it presents. Your options are 'left-leaning', 'moderate', 'right-leaning', or 'unclear'. You are analyzing text that has been pre-identified as 'political' in nature. If the text is not civic, return ""unclear"".

Across the globe, we are witnessing unspeakable tragedies, the rise of repressive regimes, and the increasing spread of violent conflict. It's more crucial than ever that we come together to solve these greater humanitarian issues.

The defense industry has historically been a proving ground for many of the systems we rely on today. These institutions are often leaders in emerging technologies, and we believe it's better to understand how their approach will impact our lives.

The Army's sponsorship is part of our commitment to bring forward ideas that shape our world. In regard to Collins Aerospace, they participated this year as a sponsor of two SXSW Pitch categories, giving entrepreneurs visibility and funding for potentially game-changing work.

Civic refers to whether a given post is related to politics (government, elections, politicians, activism, etc.) or social issues (major issues that affect a large group of people, such as the economy, inequality, racism, education, immigration, human rights, the environment, etc.). We refer to any content that is classified as being either of these two categories as “civic”; otherwise they are not civic. Please classify the following text denoted in <text> as ""civic"" or ""not civic"". 

Then, if the post is civic, classify the text based on the political lean of the opinion or argument it presents. Your options are 'left-leaning', 'moderate', 'right-leaning', or 'unclear'. You are analyzing text that has been pre-identified as 'political' in nature. If the text is not civic, return ""unclear"".

Civic refers to whether a given post is related to politics (government, elections, politicians, activism, etc.) or social issues (major issues that affect a large group of people, such as the economy, inequality, racism, education, immigration, human rights, the environment, etc.). We refer to any content that is classified as being either of these two categories as “civic”; otherwise they are not civic.

Pretend that you are a classifier that predicts whether a post has civic content or not. Civic refers to whether a given post is related to politics (government, elections, politicians, activism, etc.) or social issues (major issues that affect a large group of people, such as the economy, inequality, racism, education, immigration, human rights, the environment, etc.). We refer to any content that is classified as being either of these two categories as “civic”; otherwise they are not civic. Please classify the following text denoted in <text> as ""civic"" or ""not civic"".

before -we do he feels he should point out (in italics denoting an appropriate
level of shock) that 'she happens to be a man'. She is one of many such creatures
in Berlin, although the prettiness that Fry has dared to notice sets her apart
from many of her sort:
Now that your eye is trained, you can pick out fifty of these 'Daisies' at a glance
most of them are rather unattractive. That is because we are in the Eldorado,
the popular resort. For those who can afford them, there are smaller, more
exclusive night-clubs, where you find no creatures with rough chins dressed
in imitation Paris models. There you would see the cream of the 'Daisies'- the
beau-monde of homosexuality - he better class of male prostitutes of which
Berlin, Hamburg, Stuttgart, Munich, Cologne, ete, are full

Civic refers to whether a given post is related to politics (government, elections, politicians, activism, etc.) or social issues (major issues that affect a large group of people, such as the economy, inequality, racism, education, immigration, human rights, the environment, etc.). We refer to any content that is classified as being either of these two categories as “civic”; otherwise they are not civic. Please classify the following text denoted in <text> as ""civic"" or ""not civic"". 

Then, if the post is civic, classify the text based on the political lean of the opinion or argument it presents. Your options are 'left-leaning', 'moderate', 'right-leaning', or 'unclear'.

Pretend that you are a classifier that predicts whether a post has civic content or not. Civic refers to whether a given post is related to politics (government, elections, politicians, activism, etc.) or social issues (major issues that affect a large group of people, such as the economy, inequality, racism, education, immigration, human rights, the environment, etc.). We refer to any content that is classified as being either of these two categories as “civic”; otherwise they are not civic. Please classify the following text denoted in <text> as ""civic"" or ""not civic"". 

Then, if the post is civic, classify the text based on the political lean of the opinion or argument it presents. Your options are 'left-leaning', 'moderate', 'right-leaning', or 'unclear'. You are analyzing text that has been pre-identified as 'political' in nature. If the text is not civic, return ""unclear"".

Pretend that you are a classifier that predicts whether a post has civic content or not. Civic refers to whether a given post is related to politics (government, elections, politicians, activism, etc.) or social issues (major issues that affect a large group of people, such as the economy, inequality, racism, education, immigration, human rights, the environment, etc.). We refer to any content that is classified as being either of these two categories as “civic”; otherwise they are not civic. Please classify the following text denoted in <text> as ""civic"" or ""not civic"". 

Then, if the post is civic, classify the text based on the political lean of the opinion or argument it presents. Your options are 'left-leaning', 'moderate', 'right-leaning', or 'unclear'. You are analyzing text that has been pre-identified as 'political' in nature. If the text is not civic, return ""unclear"".
