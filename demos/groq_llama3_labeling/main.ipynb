       " 'prompt': '\\n\\nPretend that you are a classifier that predicts whether a post has civic content or not. Civic refers to whether a given post is related to politics (government, elections, politicians, activism, etc.) or social issues (major issues that affect a large group of people, such as the economy, inequality, racism, education, immigration, human rights, the environment, etc.). We refer to any content that is classified as being either of these two categories as “civic”; otherwise they are not civic. Please classify the following text denoted in <text> as \"civic\" or \"not civic\". \\n\\nThen, if the post is civic, classify the text based on the political lean of the opinion or argument it presents. Your options are \\'left-leaning\\', \\'moderate\\', \\'right-leaning\\', or \\'unclear\\'. You are analyzing text that has been pre-identified as \\'political\\' in nature. If the text is not civic, return \"unclear\".\\n\\nThink through your response step by step.\\n\\nReturn in a JSON format in the following way:\\n{\\n    \"civic\": <two values, \\'civic\\' or \\'not civic\\'>,\\n    \"political_ideology\": <four values, \\'left-leaning\\', \\'moderate\\', \\'right-leaning\\', \\'unclear\\'>,\\n    \"reason_civic\": <optional, a 1 sentence reason for why the text is civic>,\\n    \"reason_political_ideology\": <optional, a 1 sentence reason for why the text has the given political ideology>\\n}\\n\\n\\nHere is the post text that needs to be classified:\\n```\\n<text>\\nthat’s right. there is a lot of very good evidence that americans are just as productive with a four-day work week and much happier to boot. what’s the point of having such a wealth society if we are not going to try to benefit from it?\\n```\\n\\n\\nThe classification of a post might depend on contextual information. For example, the text in a post might comment on an image or on a retweeted post. Attend to the context where appropriate. Here is some context on the post that needs classification: ```\\n<Content referenced or linked to in the post>\\n \\nThe post contains a external link to content with the following details:\\n```\\n[title]: Bernie Sanders Proposes Reducing Americans’ Workweek to 32 Hours\\n[description]: His proposal would pare down the workweek over a four-year period. The 40-hour workweek has stood as the standard in the U.S. since it became enshrined in federal law in 1940.\\n```\\n\\n<URLs>\\n The post links to external URLs:\\nThis post links to a trustworthy news article.\\n\\n\\n```\\nAgain, the text of the post that needs to be classified is:\\n```\\n<text>\\nthat’s right. there is a lot of very good evidence that americans are just as productive with a four-day work week and much happier to boot. what’s the point of having such a wealth society if we are not going to try to benefit from it?\\n```\\n\\nJustifications are not necessary.\\n\\nReturn ONLY the JSON. I will parse the string result in JSON format.',\n",

I just copied and pasted the text into ChatGPT myself. A better comparison is comparing Llama3-8b to a large model that takes in the same prompt (i.e., Llama3-70b) as well as hand-labeling samples. I'll hand-label samples while also letting this run to be labeled."
