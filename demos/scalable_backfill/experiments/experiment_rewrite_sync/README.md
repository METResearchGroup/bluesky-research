# Sync Pipeline Go Rewrite Experiment

This experiment evaluates the potential performance benefits of rewriting key components of the Bluesky PDS backfill system in Go.

## Motivation

The current Python implementation of the backfill sync process faces several performance challenges:

1. **I/O Bottlenecks**: Each DID requires multiple HTTP requests to PDS servers
2. **Concurrency Limitations**: Python's concurrency model introduces overhead for I/O-bound tasks
3. **Memory Usage**: Processing large numbers of DIDs requires careful memory management
4. **Scaling Constraints**: The GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) limits true parallel execution

This experiment tests if a Go rewrite of performance-critical components can significantly improve throughput and resource utilization.

## Components Reimplemented

The Go implementation focuses on rewriting the following key components:

1. **Network Request Handling**: Improved HTTP client with connection pooling
2. **Parallel Processing**: Using Go's lightweight goroutines instead of Python processes
3. **Binary Data Processing**: More efficient CAR file parsing
4. **Memory Management**: Reduced memory overhead

## Pros of Go Rewrite

- **Concurrency**: Go's goroutines are lightweight, allowing thousands of concurrent operations
- **Memory Efficiency**: Lower per-request memory footprint
- **Performance**: More efficient I/O multiplexing and binary data handling
- **Deployment**: Compiles to a single binary for easier deployment
- **Scalability**: Better utilization of multiple CPU cores without GIL limitations

## Cons of Go Rewrite

- **Code Maintenance**: Need to maintain two implementations (Python and Go)
- **Integration Complexity**: May require message passing between components in different languages
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn and maintain Go codebase
- **Ecosystem**: Some Python libraries may not have Go equivalents
- **Development Time**: Initial development overhead to rewrite components

## Rust Alternative Consideration

While Rust offers even better performance characteristics and memory safety, Go was chosen for this experiment because:

1. Simpler learning curve for the team
2. Better fit for networked services
3. Faster development cycle
4. Good balance of performance and productivity

## Success Metrics

The experiment measures:

1. **Throughput**: DIDs processed per minute
2. **Memory Usage**: Peak and average memory consumption
3. **CPU Utilization**: How effectively each implementation uses available CPU cores
4. **Time to Completion**: Total processing time for equivalent workloads
5. **Resilience**: Behavior under error conditions and network interruptions
