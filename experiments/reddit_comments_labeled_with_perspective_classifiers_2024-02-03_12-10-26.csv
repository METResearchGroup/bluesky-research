k3e89rp,Starkoman,dhz89,"Really?  In his post-Ouster press conference (which was forty plus minutes long), McCarthy stated that Pelosi had helped him with good advice when he first became Speaker of the House.

In fact, he blamed “The Eight” Republicans who voted against him — and was fully aware that Gaetz’ motion to remove him was *personal*, which he didn’t mind.

Nowhere in that press conference did I hear McCarthy specifically or directly criticise Pelosi.

Curiously, Pelosi was apparently in the building but did not vote in the debate — even though she was called during the count and again at the end — which is one of the reasons the vote didn’t go up to 218.

Famously, she once shared the wisdom (I paraphrase): “Never put anything to a House vote unless you know what the result will be”.  Perhaps Nancy **did** know the outcome upfront today — and didn’t want to be mean by voting Yes to the removal of her successor herself.  If correct, that’s pretty classy.

Take your ""both sides"" rhetoric, and go fuck yourselves, Associated Press

Their time to build a path to negotiate was really any point between 1981 and now. Nobody forced them to use the Newt Gingrich ""I do not negotiate with anyone outside of my party"" playbook, but they did it anyway. They welcomed it. Until it suddenly turned and bit them in the face once the far-right whack-a-doodles gained a bit of power after the Republican party legitimized them by giving *them* a platform, instead of reaching across the aisle to create something a bit more bi-partisan. 

As a matter of fact, when in the minority, Republicans refused to collaborate the Democrats when they tried to reach across the aisle on healthcare - forcing the Democrats to build it themselves, which was followed by Republicans doing nothing but bitching and moaning about how partisan the bill was - non-stop, for every moment since.

So the offer would be something like Jeffries as speaker, a vote on the impeachment inquiry and Ukraine aid in exchange for a vote on border security, leave committees as is, regular order in the House (i.e. bills voted out of committee get a vote), and consultation before Jeffries brings up Senate bills for a vote. Both sides agree to fund the government along the lines of the debt ceiling agreement, and a vague commitment to do something similar next year.

They made a big stink about finally getting some power after decades of being the minority in the House.  They haven't balanced the budget, cut the deficit, secured the border. They can't even put together a budget, threaten to shut down the government every few years, and can't keep their own Speaker.

The last time the GQP had this much power in Congress was right before the Great Depression. And a few decades after regaining power they and their Presidential candidate run on 'Make America Great Again' but it looks like they are the ones fucking things up.

Interestingly, it seems to me that the age requirement for president probably could not withstand a legal challenge, if the Supreme Court were rational and consistent. For almost any other characteristic a president might have, the will of the voters is what counts. If the voters want to elect a 2-year old, that's their choice. Look at Trump.

k3hvwot,Consistent_Spread564,eokjdtod,"I agree, this is not bad at all compared to a lot of shit the Republicans say. I just hate that politics in this country has become sports for people who don't like sports. Just pure tribalism/rage-entertainment. 

If we're talking about admiration I admire leaders who are above the fray, who are a steady, strong, and reassuring presence for their people. I don't love them taking pot shots across the fence to rile people up. 

I mean pretty much the first line of the job description for a leader is to unify their people. Our country is hopelessly divided right now, that is not a good thing and we all need to grow up and stop stoking the flames cause it's only gonna make things worse and worse until we lose our democracy completely.

And I will call my own side out for it more frequently because I'm on my side because they're supposed to be *better*. So many of our politicians have no respect for the amount of power they have.

I just hate the creeping feeling there's not a single adult in the room lol. It's a little scary

k3hhpvd,SpeedySpooley,u8c9kgnh,"Moving up the career ladder without merit...usually though kissing the right asses, and/or having powerful connections.

It's used for people who aren't particularly good at their job, but through their connections or influence keep moving up the career ladder.

One example would be like another poster said...the nephew of the CEO.  He might start out in the mail room to ""learn the business"", but that's not why he's really there.  He has no interest in actually learning the mail room, it's just a thing his CEO uncle says he has to do.  He's likely going to suck at it, and make more work for the other people.  If he wasn't the CEO's nephew, he'd be fired.

He'll be moved around to different departments for a ""good fit""...creating problems all along the way...but they can't fire him.

Eventually, he'll be given an office somewhere in middle/upper management where he doesn't have to interact with the *actual* workforce.

Another example is people who kiss the right asses despite not being very good at their job.  They know how to play office politics...and who to show off in front of.  You see it often...where their co-workers will call them a fucking idiot...but management seems to love them.

My dad is a Vietnam Veteran...and he used the example of the Staff Sergeant vs the Second Lieutenant.  It takes experience to become a Staff Sergeant.  My dad said they were usually ""lifers"", or people making a career out of the Army.

Whereas a Second Lieutenant is just somebody who went to college, then Officer School.  The Second Lieutenant is superior to the Staff Sergeant in *rank* but not *experience*.

* Disclaimer that I've never served in the military and I'm just going by my dad's retelling of his experiences.

So, Kevin McCarthy being described as ""failing up"" means that he wasn't named Speaker because he was very good at his job and was the best candidate.  He was just willing to say the ""right"" things, and play the ""right"" games to put himself in that position.",/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/16zt2ae/aoc_coming_in_like_a_wrecking_ball/k3hhpvd/,1696453724.0,r/PoliticalHumor,0.84174395,1,True,2023-10-16_0427,0.37751234,0,0.41196713,0,0.50640786,1,0.68602693,1,0.34134665,0,0.7383883,1,0.2762251,0,0.7490585,1,0.33576515,0,0.8110653,1,0.6259423,1,0.73863417,1,0.6951522,1

More broadly the concept of 'men failing up' may be referring to the idea that between a mediocre man and highly performing woman it's more likely that the man will get the promotion.

Though the term 'failing up' also just generally exists to describe scenarios where people advance in life over others (fame, wealth, etc) while having no real merits to deserve them.

Easily applies to Trump's whole life.

k0sqjqk,breischl,by6lx,"Non-expert and slightly drunk here, but I've read about this a fair amount. Broadly speaking there are two kinds of carbon capture: point-source capture and direct air capture.

Point-source capture (which would include ""coal carbon capture) pulls carbon out of a high-carbon source. eg, you just burned a bunch of coal, the exhaust from that has a high concentration of CO2 in it, so you filter the CO2 from the exhaust and store it. Since the concentration is high, this tends to be easier and _relatively_ energy-efficient. Though it can be complicated by dealing with the other stuff in the exhaust. Also, it tends to capture only a fraction of what was emitted, so this is about reducing emissions by XX%, but not pulling pre-existing carbon out of the air.

""Direct air capture"" is sucking carbon out of some random bit of air. The concentration of CO2 there is just the ambient level, which is rather low. It tends to be hard to separate the carbon from everything else, and hence uses a lot of energy. There's really a wild variety of technologies here, from things involving blowers and chemicals to literally powdering rocks and throwing them in the ocean where they will absorb carbon and turn into calcium carbonate (IIRC). Many are energy intensive, which is a potential problem - if the energy comes from fossil fuels then you could end up emitting more carbon to power the process than you extract from the air. _But_ if the energy source is non-carbon-emitting then you can pull pre-existing carbon out of the air, unlike point-source capture.

So, both methods are ""carbon capture"" but they're different things. 

>Is coal the only type of carbon in the air?

Coal isn't _just_ carbon, but burning it does throw some into the air. Burning natural gas, gasoline, diesel, any fossil fuel, will add carbon to the atmosphere. There are also other sources like volcanoes that aren't under our control. Burning biomass (eg, wood) also puts carbon into the air, but in that case the plants pulled the carbon from the air in the first place, so it's net-zero.",/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/16jua4p/yeah_but_the_shareholders_are_happy/k0sqjqk/,1694839066.0,r/PoliticalHumor,0.24631491,0,True,2023-10-16_0427,0.077668175,0,0.28100443,0,0.16139136,0,0.6936657,1,0.5116801,1,0.6346753,1,0.34530815,0,0.11961466,0,0.27903244,0,0.25293535,0,0.2152146,0,0.102347136,0,0.23933682,0

Look at the piss poor access to Healthcare for example, it's tempting to say it's that way because of the wealthy keeping it that way, some polls will show up to 70% support for universal Healthcare coverage, but when that's asked as how do you feel about getting rid of the private option or socialized Healthcare support drops to like 30%, educating ourselves/others and organizing voters behind coherent policies goals would have so much more of an effect than than most of the influence of the wealthy",/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/173vgbf/2024_cheat_sheet/k4775if/,1696892824.0,r/PoliticalHumor,0.66884553,1,True,2023-10-16_0427,0.12520397,0,0.8272945,1,0.80442846,1,0.86025393,1,0.52642494,1,0.81895477,1,0.72697043,1,0.8084186,1,0.6280208,1,0.8500458,1,0.81726027,1,0.8102748,1,0.84906876,1
