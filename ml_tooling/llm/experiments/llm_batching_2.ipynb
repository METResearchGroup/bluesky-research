    "# Using LLMs to classify if social media posts are political or not (Part II).\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm working on a project that involves gathering social media posts from [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) and analyzing them. Part of that project requires knowing which posts are about political or social topics, and if so, what political side they support. Current ML classifiers don't work that well out of the box, so I'm trying to create our own classification scheme using LLMs. I'm trying to use LLMs in order to classify [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) posts as either having political content or not, and if so, the political ideology, and I've found that LLMs work quite well for this task. I've used Llama3-8b and Llama3-70b via [Groq](https://groq.com/) so far, but are also open to experimenting with other open-source models as well (I have the on-prem infrastructure to host our own models, which is much cheaper at scale).\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, I've tried using just naive text classification and then afterwards adding context to the classifications. Now that I've shown that individual prompts work, I'd like to now work on refining this approach. We already know that it works enough for a quick pilot, but (1) it runs very slow because it runs serially, and (2) we want to improve the context that we provide to the LLM even more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, there are a few new experiments things that I'd like to try:\n",
    "- Can we change the prompt format so that the post information is given as a JSON?\n",
    "- Can we implement batching? Implementing batching would have two main speed-ups:\n",
    "    - Reduce the number of requests that are sent, since we can group things together.\n",
    "    - Reduce input token count (since we don't need to add the question and background preamble portions of the prompt over and over again).\n",
    "- Can we improve the context? Can we add context about current events?\n",
    "- How does our model perform with other LLMs (e.g., Mixtral)?\n",
    "- Can we experiment with optimizing the prompt (e.g, with [dspy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy))?"
