    "# Using LLMs to classify if social media posts are political or not (Part I).\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm working on a project that involves gathering social media posts from [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) and analyzing them. Part of that project requires knowing which posts are about political or social topics, and if so, what political side they support. Current ML classifiers don't work that well out of the box, so I'm trying to create our own classification scheme using LLMs. I'm trying to use LLMs in order to classify [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) posts as either having political content or not, and if so, the political ideology, and I've found that LLMs work quite well for this task. I've used Llama3-8b and Llama3-70b via [Groq](https://groq.com/) so far, but are also open to experimenting with other open-source models as well (I have the on-prem infrastructure to host our own models, which is much cheaper at scale).\n",

    "## The evolution of our approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attempt 1: Naive text classification\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, I tried the naive, obvious approach, which is to just take the raw text of the post and ask the LLM to classify it. I started with a prompt as simple as something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{plaintext}\n",
    "Pretend that you are a classifier that predicts whether a post has sociopolitical content or not. Sociopolitical refers \\\n",

    "racism, education, immigration, human rights, the environment, etc.). We refer to any content \\\n",
    "that is classified as being either of these two categories as \"sociopolitical\"; otherwise they are not sociopolitical. \\\n",
    "Please classify the following text denoted in <text> as \"sociopolitical\" or \"not sociopolitical\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, if the post is sociopolitical, classify the text based on the political lean of the opinion or argument \\\n",
    "it presents. Your options are \"democrat\", \"republican\", or 'unclear'. \\\n",
    "You are analyzing text that has been pre-identified as 'political' in nature. \\\n",
    "If the text is not sociopolitical, return \"unclear\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Think through your response step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return in a JSON format in the following way:\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"sociopolitical\": <two values, 'sociopolitical' or 'not sociopolitical'>,\n",

    "\n",
    "However, looking at just the post text itself isn't enough. If we look at the thread that the post is a part of, we as humans can clearly tell this post is replying to another post and, if we know what post it's replying to, we can clearly tell that it's political and left-leaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these posts, the text in and of itself inherently is insufficient. Here's some more examples that the LLM would've classified incorrectly:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Example Bluesky post without context](assets/images/sample_post_no_context_2.png \"Example Bluesky post without context\")\n",
    "![Example Bluesky post without context](assets/images/sample_post_no_context_3.png \"Example Bluesky post without context\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Just by looking at the text of the post themselves, it would've been impossible for the LLM to classify these correctly. For the first image, the LLM doesn't have the appropriate knowledge cutoff to classify this correct:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"sociopolitical\": \"sociopolitical\",\n",
    "    \"political_ideology\": \"unclear\",\n",
    "    \"reason_sociopolitical\": \"The text mentions political dynamics involving job retention and loss due to interactions with politicians.\",\n",
    "    \"reason_political_ideology\": \"The text does not provide enough information to determine a specific political ideology or lean.\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second image, the meaning of the post is within the image itself, so the LLM not knowing what's in the image makes it unable to classify the image correctly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"sociopolitical\": \"not sociopolitical\",\n",
    "    \"political_ideology\": \"unclear\",\n",
    "    \"reason_sociopolitical\": \"\",\n",
    "    \"reason_political_ideology\": \"\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What would have helped the LLM classify these posts correctly? I'm using the LLM here as a large comprehension machine, but if I want the LLM to work well, I need to give it the same info that I would give to a person who's unfamiliar with US politics if I were to ask them to classify this same task themselves. After all, for example, if a post references current events that are after the knowledge cutoff of the LLM (very likely given how quickly news cycles move), we'll need to supply that knowledge ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells us that a way to improve our approach towards classification is to also include context as well about the post. We're not going to get all the meaning of a post from just the text itself, and as humans we also don't look at just the text of a post to get its meaning anyways. Logically, we should be giving the same information to the LLM that we ourselves would want to use in order to classify this task."
