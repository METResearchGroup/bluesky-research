    "# Using LLMs to classify if social media posts are political or not (Part II).\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm working on a project that involves gathering social media posts from [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) and analyzing them. Part of that project requires knowing which posts are about political or social topics, and if so, what political side they support. Current ML classifiers don't work that well out of the box, so I'm trying to create our own classification scheme using LLMs. I'm trying to use LLMs in order to classify [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) posts as either having political content or not, and if so, the political ideology, and I've found that LLMs work quite well for this task. I've used Llama3-8b and Llama3-70b via [Groq](https://groq.com/) so far, but are also open to experimenting with other open-source models as well (I have the on-prem infrastructure to host our own models, which is much cheaper at scale).\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, I've tried using just naive text classification and then afterwards adding context to the classifications. Now that I've shown that individual prompts work, I've also worked on how to include batching and adding some (simple) scaling for the prompts. I'd like to improve the approach even more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, there are a few new experiments things that I'd like to try:\n",
    "- Can we improve the context? Can we add context about current events?\n",
    "- How does our model perform with other LLMs (e.g., Mixtral)?\n",
    "- Can we experiment with optimizing the prompt (e.g, with [dspy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy))?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I'll go over the first point:\n",
    "- Can we improve the context? Can we add context about current events?"
