# ML Tooling

Repository of ML-related functionalities shared across the different ML services in the project. Each of the ML-specific functionalities are stored here, and the `classify_records` services and pipelines provide scaffolding for managing the inference components of each model.

`requirements.in`: contains the dependencies for running the tooling in production.
`dev_requirements.in`: contains the dependencies for running the tooling in development (e.g., for testing/CI).
