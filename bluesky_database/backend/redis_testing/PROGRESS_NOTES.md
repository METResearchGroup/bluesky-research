  - ℹ️ **Explanation**: Evictions only trigger when `used_memory` exceeds `maxmemory`. This run peaked at ~95% of the 2 GB limit and therefore did not cross the eviction threshold. To observe evictions directly, rerun the test so that memory usage exceeds the configured limit (e.g., ~2.05 GB) or adjust the workload to intentionally surpass `maxmemory`.
  - ✅ **MEMORY STABILITY**: Memory utilization remained stable at 94.2-95.0%
  - ✅ **PERFORMANCE STABILITY**: Average 44.9 ops/sec under pressure (lower but stable)
  - ✅ **RECOVERY TEST**: Successfully recovered after removing 1,000 keys

### 📊 Performance Highlights
- **Throughput**: 1,500+ ops/sec sustained (throughput test)
- **Concurrent Scaling**: 7,023 ops/sec with 10 threads
- **Memory Efficiency**: 78.5% peak utilization (buffer test)
- **Data Integrity**: 100% success rate across all tests
