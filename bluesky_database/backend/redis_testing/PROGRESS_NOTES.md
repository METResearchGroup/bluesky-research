## Summary

The Redis optimization work has been highly successful. The current Redis configuration already exceeds all MET-001 requirements, and the buffer capacity test validates that Redis can handle the full 8-hour buffer capacity of 2.7M events with excellent performance and data integrity. The focus has shifted from optimization to validation and production readiness testing.

**Current Status**: Phase 2 completed successfully. Ready to proceed with Phase 3 validation testing.
