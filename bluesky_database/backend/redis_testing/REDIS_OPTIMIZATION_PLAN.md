# Redis Optimization Plan for Bluesky Data Pipeline

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive optimization plan for Redis to meet the buffer use case requirements specified in MET-001. The goal is to configure Redis specifically for high-throughput data buffering with 8-hour capacity and optimal performance.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure
- Redis 7.2-alpine container with Docker Compose
- Basic configuration with 2GB memory limit
- AOF persistence with `appendfsync everysec`
- LRU eviction policy (`allkeys-lru`)
- Authentication support via `REDIS_PASSWORD`

### Identified Optimization Areas
1. **Configuration Validation**: Verify current settings match MET-001 requirements
2. **Performance Baseline**: Establish current performance metrics
3. **Memory Management**: Optimize for 2.7M events buffer capacity
4. **Persistence Strategy**: Validate AOF configuration for data durability
5. **Load Testing**: Comprehensive testing under production-like conditions
6. **Monitoring Integration**: Buffer overflow detection and alerting

## Testing Strategy

### Test Data Requirements
- **Realistic Event Data**: Generate mock Bluesky firehose events with proper data structures
- **Volume Testing**: Test with 2.7M events (8-hour buffer capacity)
- **Load Patterns**: Simulate realistic firehose patterns with bursts and sustained load
- **Data Types**: Test all Bluesky event types (posts, likes, follows, reposts, blocks)

### Performance Targets
- **Throughput**: 1000+ operations/second sustained
- **Latency**: <10ms average response time
- **Memory**: <80% utilization under normal load
- **Recovery**: <30 seconds for Redis restart recovery
