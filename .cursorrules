    - Code review skills and ability to provide constructive feedback
    - Following security best practices and compliance requirements
    - Understanding of technical debt management

[Project Structure]

The project is structured as follows:
    - .github: Contains the CI logic to run the tests and linting.
    - agents: experimental directory with prompts for LLM agents.
    - api: a centralized API for managing routing across different microservices.
    - assets: deprecated with example images.
    - demos: one-off demos for testing, development, and presentation.
    - Dockerfiles: contains the Dockerfile for each service.
    - experiments: one-off experiments for testing, development, and presentation.
    - feed_api: contains the FastAPI application for running the web server that
    Bluesky interacts with and which serves up the actual feeds.
    - lib: general tooling helpful across different functions
    - ml_tooling: ML-specific tooling
    - orchestration: Orchestration logic for specific components of work
    (e.g., data pipeline, etc.)
    - pipelines: Contains logic for holistic units of work (at the level of a specific
    microservice). Normally most pipelines
    just have a "handler.py" interface and the logic is handled within the corresponding
    "service" directory (e.g., the logic of "pipelines/write_cache_buffers" is handled
    by "services/write_cache_buffers/main.py"). However, some pipelines do import
    from multiple services. This structure came about in order to have a higher
    level of abstraction to be able to compose together different units of work.
    - scripts: generally one-off scripts for doing units of work.
    - services: Contains the main logic for each microservice. This is where
    most work is done. Most microservices have a "main.py" file that is the main
    entrypoint for the microservice, as well as a "helper.py" file that handles
    most actual logic for the microservice.
    - terraform: contains the terraform code for the infrastructure. Relevant
    for deployments to AWS.
    - transform: code for wrangling and transform data ingested directly from
    the Bluesky API firehose.

For each service, the code is typically handled at the top level, with a main.py or a
handler.py file. From there, follow the track of the imports in the code to find the other files that are used in the code.

[Code Style and Standards]

- Clear project structure with separate directories for source code, tests, docs, and config.
- Modular design with distinct files for models, services, controllers, and utilities
- Comprehensible variable and function names
- Consistent naming conventions for classes, files, and directories
- Clear separation of concerns between files
- Proper use of whitespace and consistent formatting
- Docstrings for all functions and classes
- Error handling and edge case management

[README standards]

For any README file, be sure to include the following sections.

```
    <Service Title>

    <High-level overview of the service>

    <Detailed explanation of the code>
        - Do so in steps. The functions have detailed docstrings. Each
        function is designed in a composable way, so you can follow the
        logic of the code by following the layering and composition of the
        functions.

    <Testing details>
        - Tests are typically detailed in a "tests/" directory. Note the
        location of the tests for the given code. Then review the docstrings
        of the files in the "tests/" directory to understand what is tested.
        Then, in bullet points, outline (1) the name of the test file and
        which file is being tested, and then in sub-bullets, outline the tests 
        that are being done.
```

[Documentation Standards]

- For any python file, be sure to ALWAYS add typing annotations to each function or class. Be sure to include return types when necessary. Add descriptive docstrings to all python functions and classes as well.

[Writing Git Commit Messages]

The commit message should be in the present tense, and should be no more
than 50 characters. Append with " (via Composer LLM)" to indicate that the
commit message was generated by the Composer LLM.

I want these types of commit messages:
```
    - (feat): A new feature was added.
    - (fix): A bug was fixed.
    - (refactor): The code was refactored.
    - (test): A test was added or modified.
    - (docs): The documentation was updated.
    - (chore): Miscellaneous changes.
```

The commit message should be formatted as follows:
```
[type] <description> (via Composer LLM)
```
