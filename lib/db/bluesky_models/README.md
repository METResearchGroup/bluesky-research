# Bluesky Models

A base repo to store models for objects synced from Bluesky.

This is based off the models in the [Bluesky Python repo](https://github.com/MarshalX/atproto/tree/main/packages/atproto_client/models), but repurposed to grab the objects that are specifically used in the project.

Contains a few custom models (which are indicated) that closely touch the raw Bluesky models.
