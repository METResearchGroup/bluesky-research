Respectfully, let's just go through some history. 

In 2000, Palestinians walk away from a very, very good peace deal which included a sovereign state (a “Free Palestine,” if you will.)

They then launch the Second Intifada. Israeli civilians are living though five years of suicide bombings, mass shootings and rocket attacks. This massively deteriorated any chance at peace. 

We both agree that Netanyahu has been horrible. But it's simply factual that Palestinians created the conditions that led to his rise.
