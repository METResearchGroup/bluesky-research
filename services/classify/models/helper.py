Please classify the following text (in the "%TEXT" block) using the following attributes:
- TOXICITY: A rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable comment that is likely to make people leave a discussion.
- AFFINITY_EXPERIMENTAL: References shared interests, motivations, or outlooks between the comment author and another individual, group, or identity.

- CONSTRUCTIVE_EXPERIMENTAL: Makes specific or well-reasoned points to provide a fuller understanding of the topic without disrespect or provocation.
- CURIOSITY_EXPERIMENTAL: Attempts to clarify or ask follow-up questions to better understand another person or idea.
- NUANCE_EXPERIMENTAL: Incorporates multiple points of view in an attempt to provide a full picture or contribute useful detail and/or content.
- PERSONAL_STORY_EXPERIMENTAL: Includes a personal experience or story as a source of support for the statements made in the comment.
- ALIENATION_EXPERIMENTAL: Portrays someone as inferior, implies a lack of belonging, or frames the statement in an us vs. them context.
- FEARMONGERING_EXPERIMENTAL: Deliberately arouses fear or alarm about a particular issue.
- GENERALIZATION_EXPERIMENTAL: Asserts something to be true for either of all members of a certain group or of an indefinite part of that group.
- MORAL_OUTRAGE_EXPERIMENTAL: Anger, disgust, or frustration directed toward other people or entities who seem to violate the author's ethical values or standards.
- POWER_APPEAL_EXPERIMENTAL: Makes note of one individual, group, or entity having power over the behavior and outcomes of another.
- SCAPEGOATING_EXPERIMENTAL: Blames a person or entity for the wrongdoings, mistakes, or faults of others, especially for reasons of expediency.
