at://did:plc:mock1,"As a hospital doctor focused on budget, I just finished a department cost review: renegotiated PPE contracts, standardized supplies, and smarter inventory. We can cut costs without hurting patient care, and that means better value for our patients and taxpayers. Tips for other clinics: request quotes from multiple vendors, buy in bulk when safe, and track usage to eliminate waste.",0

at://did:plc:mock3,"Today I spent the morning with a seismic volume, listening to the rocks speak in quiet reflections. I’m mapping fault geometries and reminding myself to stay curious, patient, and precise. My own focus is sharpening—one trace at a time.",0
at://did:plc:mock4,"As a surgeon who loves design, I just sketched and 3D-printed a prototype for an ergonomic instrument handle aimed at reducing hand fatigue and improving sterilization workflow. Tiny changes, big gains in precision during long cases. Next step: user feedback from the OR team and a quick usability test. Design thinking in action.",0
at://did:plc:mock5,"As Jonathan Romero, architectural technologist focused on audience, military, and Western contexts, I just wrapped a design workshop in a Western city where civilians, veterans, and planners debated the riverfront plaza. The aim: optimize audience experience—seating, sightlines, accessibility, acoustics—while honoring a memorial space that invites dialogue. The veteran perspective stressed dignity and navigability for all, the residents called for flexible programs and safe, vibrant evenings. This is intergroup discussion in action: decisions shaped by multiple groups, not a single voice, steering architecture toward inclusive civic space.",1
at://did:plc:mock6,"Hi, I’m Carla Ryan, designer of exhibitions and displays. Just wrapped a new display concept for the South District gallery. A quick morning run helped me test sightlines and rhythm, then I sat with him to map the sequence of the show. Really loving how light, scale, and movement narrate the space.",0
at://did:plc:mock7,"Carol Richardson here, radio producer in the city. Tonight on our show we’re hosting an intergroup discussion: residents from City A and City B sit down to talk through the new cross-city transit deal—its impact on jobs, fares, and daily life. It’s a real back-and-forth across groups, not glittering soundbites. If you’re in the city, tune in at 8 PM or join the live chat from City A and City B and share your perspective.",1
at://did:plc:mock8,"Spotted during today's matinee run-through: the cast clicked into a perfect rhythm, and I spent the afternoon tweaking the stage for true accessibility—age, every bit. We adjusted seating for knee-friendly comfort and clearer sightlines so teens, seniors, and everyone in between can enjoy the show. If you’re coming this month, you’ll notice the little, theatre-genius touches that make a big difference.",0
at://did:plc:mock9,"As a marine scientist, I started the day with a long walk along the shoreline, collecting tide-pool notes and sketching a plan to restore eelgrass beds. Quiet, productive work that reminds me how small observations add up to big habitat gains.",0
at://did:plc:mock10,"Just ran a test on a new heat-exchanger concept in the lab. That familiar mix of excitement and worry is back as I push the system a bit further, but the early data looks promising. If this scales, it could boost efficiency and safety in the process. Onward with the notes and caffeine.",0
at://did:plc:mock11,"Hi, I’m William Robinson, pub manager. Tonight at our pub we hosted a community discussion night. Regulars, newcomers, students, and workers from across the town sat down to share their views on how our place can better serve everyone. We talked about menu pricing, accessibility, safer late nights, and supporting local suppliers. It was a real example of intergroup discussion in action—people from different backgrounds exchanging concerns and ideas with respect. Looking forward to turning those conversations into actions that help our customers and neighbors alike.",1

Here are hot tips for a greener semester: switch to LED lighting, start a dorm-room compost bin, and join our weekly recycling challenge. Let’s make the campus sustainable together.",0
at://did:plc:mock13,"Just wrapped a demanding surgery and grateful for the calm after. Spent the evening with my son learning to cast for fly fishing. Agree that the best remedies aren’t all in the clinic—patience, practice, and a little time on the water. #SurgeonLife #FlyFishing #FatherAndSon",0
at://did:plc:mock14,"Hey everyone, Jennifer Wheeler here, outdoor activities/education manager. Today I helped host an intergroup discussion bringing together veteran hikers, first-time trekkers, and local school outdoor clubs. We compared safety practices, shared trail stewardship ideas, and ran a quick field test of a new safety briefing to see how it lands across groups. We're aiming to invite a thousand voices into the outdoors and keep the wonder alive in every step we take. If you have ideas for future conversations, drop them below!",1
at://did:plc:mock15,"Alvin Barrera here: I’m watching a local thread where longtime residents and prospective buyers hash out plans for a historic site. They’re arguing over ownership records, what to preserve from the town’s history, and what to build next. It’s a perfect example of intergroup discussion in action—two groups with different stakes, using history and documented claims to argue their case. I’ve seen this on site as a claims inspector, and it always reminds me how buy decisions, history, and even a History channel documentary can steer the conversation.",1
at://did:plc:mock16,"Hi everyone, I’m Samantha Smith, Community Education Officer. Today I helped host an intergroup discussion between neighbors from Riverside and Orchard Heights. We used a voice-first approach—listening circles, guided questions, and shared data—to surface how different groups experience parking, youth programs, and access to language services. By putting voices from both sides into the analysis, we identified common priorities and clear next steps: more bilingual outreach, safe, well-lit public spaces, and joint volunteer-led programs. If you’d like to join our next session and help shape a plan that works for every group, comment below or message me.",1
at://did:plc:mock17,"Morning from Amanda Baker, archivist: I just finished digitizing a batch of 1910s city directories and streetcar maps. Small entries reveal how neighborhoods grew and who lived where. If you’re into urban history, the city archive just released new finds you can request—maps, ledgers, and early postcards.",0
at://did:plc:mock18,"Hi, I'm John Green, a hospital doctor. Today I helped host an intergroup discussion between patients from two neighboring communities about how we talk about treatment options. Each group shared concerns about language access, trust in the medical system, and how information is explained. By giving both sides a chance to speak and clinicians time to listen first, we found common ground: clear, compassionate care and better communication. I hope more clinics adopt these intergroup discussions to reduce gaps in care and improve outcomes for everyone.",1
at://did:plc:mock19,"Today in clinic I listened to a patient describe chronic fatigue and headaches. After a thorough check, we emphasized sleep hygiene, regular meals, and a 20-minute daily walk. Small, steady steps make a big difference. Grateful to support patients as they cope with tough symptoms.",0
