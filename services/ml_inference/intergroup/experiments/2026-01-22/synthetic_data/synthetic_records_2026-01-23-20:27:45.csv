People from different cultural groups, ages, and backgrounds sat together to share experiences, hear each other’s perspectives, and brainstorm how art can help bridge gaps in our community. We talked about how misunderstandings arise, what we value in our shared spaces, and how a collaborative mural and community performance could reflect all voices. If you're interested in joining future sessions, DM me or drop by the Community Arts Lab this Saturday afternoon. Let's use creativity to build trust and connection across our groups.",1

at://did:plc:mock8,"As a research officer for the union, I’ve been documenting and guiding what we’re calling intergroup dialogue within our workplace: conversations that span different groups—production line workers, quality control, maintenance, logistics, supervisors, and management reps. The aim is to move beyond silos and surface shared stakes so we can build durable relationships that sustain fair, safe, and productive work. Over the last month we’ve hosted a series of facilitated sessions with ground rules, equal airtime, and a structured format designed to surface interests, not positions. What we’re hearing is a mix of concern and opportunity. Some groups point to scheduling reliability, pay progression, and clarity around career ladders; others flag safety, workload balance, and the pace of process improvements. When we name the underlying interests—respect, predictability, a sense of voice in decisions—the conversations begin to shift from “us vs. them” to “how do we fix this together?” Intergroup dialogue is working because it respects legitimacy, creates a safe space for tough topics, and translates talk into action, not just transcripts and memos.

We’ve used a simple “dialogue map” to capture themes by group, identify overlapping concerns, and co-design small, testable pilots that cross group lines—like adjusted shift rotations with enhanced safety checks and joint problem-solving huddles. Early signs are encouraging: trust in the process is rising, willingness to listen is higher, and teams are proposing concrete pilots that came directly from cross-group exchanges rather than from a top-down mandate.

For fellow unions and employers contemplating intergroup dialogue, here are three practical takeaways:
- Frame the process around shared outcomes, not only grievances, to keep conversations productive.
- Ensure equal voice and rotating speakers so every group feels heard.
- Commit to transparent follow-through: publish a short summary, tie recommendations to a concrete action plan, and report back on progress.

Going forward, we’ll publish a concise synthesis of themes and a negotiation-ready plan that links intergroup dialogue outcomes to bargaining priorities. If relationships matter—as they must in any lasting workplace agreement—intergroup dialogue is not a sideline activity but a core tool for translating relationships into tangible change.",1
