at://did:plc:mock9,"As a psychotherapist and dance‑movement facilitator, I’m reflecting on how a mixed‑age, multi‑background group can engage in intergroup discussion after a shared movement exercise. We invited each person to share a memory that shapes how they show up with others, then used breath and space to listen across differences. The body offered a safe entry point to discuss stereotypes and assumptions that often separate groups, turning tension into curiosity and connection.",1
