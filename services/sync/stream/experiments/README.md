# Experiments Directory

This directory contains experimental code and prototypes that are not part
of the production codebase.

## Purpose

Experimental implementations and proof-of-concept code for:
- Performance optimizations (e.g., Bloom filters)
- Alternative architectural approaches
- Feature prototypes

## Guidelines

- Experimental code should be clearly marked as such
- Include documentation explaining the experiment's purpose
- Consider moving successful experiments to production code after validation
