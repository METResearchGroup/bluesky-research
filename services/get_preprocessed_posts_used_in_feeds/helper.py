"""Helper functions for getting preprocessed posts used in feeds.

This service takes the posts used in feeds and loads their preprocessed versions
from the preprocessed_posts service. This allows us to track which preprocessed
posts were actually used in feeds. The service supports loading data with a lookback
window to ensure we capture all relevant preprocessed posts.
