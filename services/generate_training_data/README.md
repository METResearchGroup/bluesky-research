# Generate training data

We need training data for our various ML models, for various purposes (such as fine-tuning a model, clarifying expected behaviors, and comparing the quality of feeds).

We'll need a way to systematically gather training data as needed. This service, powered by [Label Studio](https://labelstud.io/), will help with data annotation and labeling.

[Here](https://labelstud.io/guide/quick_start) are the instructions for getting set up with Label Studio.
