Daily Proportion Calculation Logic Review for Toxicity-Constructiveness Study

This script implements the review and validation of daily probability/proportion calculation
logic to determine whether systematic errors in calculation methods are the source of
observed correlations between toxicity and constructiveness scores.

Research Question: "Assuming the above two checks out, review the logic for calculating
the daily probability/proportion checks. I'd be surprised if it were at this step, mostly
because the problem would be more systematic since I use the same calculation logic across
all the fields."

The analysis will:
- Review the daily proportion calculation logic in condition_aggregated.py
- Validate that calculations are mathematically correct and consistent
- Check for systematic errors that could affect all fields uniformly
- Verify that the same calculation approach produces consistent results across features
- Analyze whether calculation artifacts could explain observed correlations
- Document the calculation methodology and validation results

This calculation logic review serves as Phase 3 of the correlation investigation project and
depends on the completion of both baseline correlation analysis (Phase 1) and feed selection
bias analysis (Phase 2). The user expects this is unlikely to be the source of correlations
since the same calculation logic is used across all fields.
