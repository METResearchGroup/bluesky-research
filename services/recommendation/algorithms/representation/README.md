# Representation algorithm
The purpose of this algorithm is to increase representativeness of discourse. We want to create boundaries on discourse that tends to be normally overrepresented in normal social media design, as well as promote conversations that lead to prosocial conversation.

We do the following:
- We uprank:
    - Prosocial arguments
    - Compassion
- We downrank:
    - Uers who are high-frequency posters
    - Toxicity
    - Alienation
    - Moral outrage
