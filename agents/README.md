# Agents

Experiments with LLM-powered agents for various tasks.

For example, can we use agents to review code, write tests, and more?

Some ideas for agents:

- PRD agent: an agent designed for writing and designing PRDs
- Code review agent: an agent designed for reviewing code and providing feedback
- Test writing agent: an agent designed for writing tests for code
- Code refactoring agent: an agent designed for refactoring code
- Code generation agent: an agent designed for generating code
- Code debugging agent: an agent designed for debugging code
- Code documentation agent: an agent designed for documenting code
