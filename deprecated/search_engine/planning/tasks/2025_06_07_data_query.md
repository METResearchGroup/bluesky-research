# Bluesky Data Access App Demo - Daily Task Tracking

## üìù Overview
This document tracks daily progress on the Streamlit Data Access App Demo as defined in [2025_06_07_data_query_prd.md](../prd/2025_06_07_data_query_prd.md). The goal is to deliver a fully interactive, demo-ready data-access interface for Bluesky social science research within 2 weeks. All implementation code will be developed in the new `search_engine/app_v2` directory.

## üìã Task Checklist

### UI Components
- [x] [#001] Filter Builder Panel (4‚ÄØhrs)
  - [x] Accordion sections for: Temporal, Content, Sentiment, Political, User, Engagement, Network
  - [x] Chips display for active filters
  - [x] Selecting controls displays chips in header
  - [x] Dependencies: sample JSON schema for filters
  - [x] Tooltips for all filter controls

- [x] [#002] Query Preview & Sample Data (3‚ÄØhrs)
  - [x] Static sample tables (posts, users, reactions)
  - [x] Display top 5 rows matching filter state
  - [x] Changing filter toggles sample rows accordingly

- [x] [#003] Visualization Quick‚ÄëLook (3‚ÄØhrs)
  - [x] Mini line chart showing daily count (mock data)
  - [x] Use Streamlit's `st.altair_chart` with sample time series
  - [x] Reacts to date‚Äërange filter

- [x] [#004] Export & Templates Panel (3‚ÄØhrs)
  - [x] Export button triggers download of sample CSV/Parquet. Call the file
  something like "results_{timestamp}.{csv/parquet}".
  - [x] Export downloads file

- [x] [#005] Create example queries.
  - [x] Create an "Example queries" section above "Active filters".
  - [x] This new section is a dropdown with several buttons. Each button corresponds
  to an example query. See the PRD for example queries. Use 5 queries that can
  be fulfilled with the query parameters. Verify that they can be fulfilled
  with the query parameters.
  - [x] If a user clicks one of these example queries, the filters are replaced
  with those parameters. The elements in the "Filter Builder Panel" are replaced
  with those parameters, which should also be reflected in the "Active filters'
  as well.
  - [x] Create unit tests to verify this functionality.

- [x] [#006] Extra Usability Features & Final Polish
  - **Immediate Impact**
    - [x] Multiply sample data by 1,000 for demo (scaling). Do this only in the UI
    and when the demo is run. The tests must still use the original sample data dataset.
    - [x] Show progress bar or spinner when filtering/exporting large datasets
    - [x] Bug: max_results now respected in preview and export.
    - [x] Lazy loading in preview tables (show first N rows, "Show more"). Show a maximum of 100 rows in the preview. Start with showing first 10 rows, then when "Show more" is clicked, show up to the first 100 rows. Also when the 100 rows is displayed, the "Show more" button should become "Show less" and then go back to showing 10 if "Show less" is clicked. If only 10 rows are shown, "Show more" should be shown, and if 100 rows are shown, "Show less" should be shown.
    - [x] Export feedback: toast/message for export started/completed
    - [x] Sticky/fixed export button or floating action button
    - [x] Clear state feedback ("No filters selected. Showing all data.")
    - [x] Filter summary sentence above preview
    - [x] "Reset All" button to clear all filters
    - [x] Collapsible "Getting Started"/help section at top
    - [x] Friendly error message and suggestions if no results
    - [x] Export preview/summary before download (record count, size, format)
    - [x] Add a "Have questions or feedback?" panel. Put this below the "Export Results Panel" panel. For this, have the following cases, (1) something like "Can't find the data you're looking for? Looking for more data than just a 1 week sample? Interested in contributing or collaborating with us? Reach out!" (underline "Reach out"). Make this a clickable item that can be expanded when clicked. Also include inputs for their email/contact info and then a message and then a "Submit" button (can change the wording accordingly).

  - **Nice-to-Have**
    - [x] Allow user to select columns for export (checkboxes)
    - [x] Copy query/filter state to clipboard (JSON or readable string)

  - **Visual Polish**
    - [x] High-contrast mode and color/contrast accessibility
