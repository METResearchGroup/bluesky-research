## Enhanced Aggregator with Job Config Integration and YAML Support

Today I made significant improvements to the distributed job coordination system, focusing on the Aggregator component and configuration management:

1. **Aggregator Job Config Integration**: 
   - Completed the Aggregator's configuration loading functionality
   - Integrated S3 utilities to download job configurations
   - Implemented proper handling of output specifications (format, compression, location)
   - Added support for partition keys in the output configuration
   - Removed placeholder TODOs with proper implementation

2. **YAML Configuration Support**:
   - Added YAML serialization and deserialization capabilities to S3 utilities
   - Created new methods `write_yaml_to_s3` and `read_yaml_from_s3` 
   - Transitioned job configurations from JSON to YAML format
   - Updated all relevant utility methods to use the new YAML-based approach

3. **Output Configuration Enhancement**:
   - Extended the OutputConfig model with critical fields:
     - `output_location`: Destination for processed data
     - `partition_keys`: Configuration for data partitioning strategy
   - Ensured proper validation of configuration parameters

The Aggregator component is now fully configured with proper job configurations loaded from S3. This allows for more flexible output management, including customizable formats, compression options, and partitioning strategies. The transition to YAML for configuration files also provides more readable and maintainable configuration options compared to JSON.

With these changes, the distributed job coordination system now has a complete configuration pipeline from job definition through execution to result aggregation, with all components properly integrated through the shared configuration system.

Next steps:

- Complete comprehensive tests for the Aggregator component
- Implement end-to-end testing of the full workflow with real data
- Add performance optimizations for large-scale aggregation tasks
- Finalize documentation for the entire system

The distributed job coordination system is progressing well toward production readiness, with all major components now implemented and properly integrated.
