# System Design Evaluation Criteria for Internet-Scale Systems

*Created with the help of Claude Sonnet 3.7*

## Introduction

This document outlines criteria for evaluating system designs targeted at operating at internet scale (millions to billions of users/operations). Each criterion is rated on a scale of 1-10 with specific benchmarks for poor (1), average (5), and excellent (10) implementations.

## 1. Scalability

The ability of the system to handle growth in users, data volume, and request rates.

| Rating | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Fixed capacity with hard limits; scaling requires rewrite; no consideration of bottlenecks |
| 5 | Scales linearly with some manual intervention; identified bottlenecks with basic remediation |
| 10 | Horizontal scaling across all components; auto-scaling capabilities; proven patterns for 10-1000x growth; no critical bottlenecks; partition strategies for all key resources |

## 2. Fault Tolerance

How well the system continues functioning when components fail.

| Rating | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Single points of failure; no redundancy; failures cause data loss; manual recovery required |
| 5 | Basic redundancy; automated recovery for common failures; some degraded performance during failures |
| 10 | No single points of failure; graceful degradation; comprehensive failure domain isolation; automatic recovery for all failure scenarios; data durability guarantees; chaos engineering ready |

## 3. Operational Excellence

How efficiently the system can be deployed, monitored, maintained, and troubleshooted.

|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Manual operations; minimal monitoring; tribal knowledge required; difficult to trace issues |
| 5 | Documented operations; basic monitoring and alerting; standard logs; runbooks for common issues |
| 10 | Fully automated operations; comprehensive observability; structured logging at all layers; detailed metrics; sophisticated alerting; zero-touch deployments; issue prediction |

## 4. Consistency & Data Integrity

How the system ensures data correctness across distributed components.

| Rating | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | No consistency guarantees; data loss possible; no validation; no transactional boundaries |
| 5 | Basic consistency models; data validation at entry points; identified consistency requirements |
| 10 | Well-defined consistency models chosen for each component; proven integrity mechanisms; atomic operations where needed; data lifecycle fully mapped; reconciliation processes for all failure modes |

## 5. Performance Efficiency

How efficiently the system utilizes resources and minimizes latency.

| Rating | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | No performance considerations; unoptimized algorithms; excessive resource usage |
| 5 | Basic optimizations; some caching; performance SLOs defined; reasonable resource usage |
| 10 | Comprehensive optimization strategy; multi-layered caching; proven algorithms for core operations; data locality considerations; resource usage modeled and optimized; p99 latency targets |

## 6. Security & Compliance

How well the system protects data and complies with requirements.

| Rating | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Minimal security considerations; no access controls; sensitive data unprotected |
| 5 | Basic security practices; defined access controls; encryption for sensitive data |
| 10 | Defense in depth; comprehensive authentication/authorization; encryption in transit and at rest; audit logging; privacy by design; compliance mapped to technical controls; threat modeling |

## 7. Cost Efficiency

How economically the system utilizes resources.

| Rating | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | No cost considerations; overprovisioned resources; inefficient architecture |
| 5 | Basic cost awareness; reasonable resource allocation; some optimization for expensive operations |
| 10 | Cost modeling across all components; optimized resource usage; elastic scaling tied to demand; efficient storage tiering; workload-specific optimizations; ROI calculations for all major components |

## 8. Testability

How thoroughly the system can be tested.

| Rating | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Minimal testing strategy; manual testing; no failure testing |
| 5 | Basic unit/integration tests; some automated testing; test environments defined |
| 10 | Comprehensive testing strategy; automated at all levels; failure injection; chaos engineering; performance testing; security testing; realistic load testing; canary deployments |

## 9. Adaptability & Evolvability

How easily the system can adapt to changing requirements.

| Rating | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Rigid architecture; tightly coupled components; difficult to modify |
| 5 | Some modularity; basic interfaces defined; reasonable change process |
| 10 | Highly modular; well-defined interfaces; versioned APIs; feature flags; backward compatibility guarantees; clear extension points; data schema evolution strategy |

## 10. Implementation Feasibility

How realistic the design is to implement with available resources.

| Rating | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Requires expertise or resources far beyond availability; unrealistic timeline; unproven technologies |
| 5 | Moderate technical challenge; generally available skills; reasonable timeline; mostly proven technologies |
| 10 | Clear implementation path; skills match requirements; phased approach with incremental value; well-understood technologies; realistic timeline with buffer; identified risks with mitigation strategies |
