# ðŸ“¦ Distributed Job Orchestration Framework â€” Implementation Tracker (with Testing Plan)

*Generated with GPT4o*

This document breaks down the implementation plan into structured epics, stories, checklists, and a testing plan based on the PRD v2. Use this to guide implementation, verification, and validation.

## ðŸ§­ High-Level Epics Overview

| Epic | Description | Outcome |
|------|-------------|---------|
| EPIC 1 | Core Orchestration Engine | Batch generation, job manifests, Slurm task submission |
| EPIC 2 | Worker Execution & Checkpointing | Stateless worker jobs, manifest updates, SQLite outputs |
| EPIC 3 | Retry & Resilience | Error classification, retry queuing via SQS |
| EPIC 4 | Aggregation & Finalization | SQLite/Parquet merge, hierarchical aggregation, job finalization |
| EPIC 5 | Rate Limiting | Token lease system via DynamoDB |
| EPIC 6 | Observability & Monitoring | Logs, dashboards, metrics, alerts |
| EPIC 7 | CLI & UX Tooling | `slurmctl` commands, manifest inspection, error analysis |
| EPIC 8 | Testing & Integration | Unit/integration/scale testing, fault simulations |

## âœ… Story Format

Each story below includes:
- ðŸŽ¯ Goal
- ðŸ“‹ Implementation Checklist
- ðŸ§ª Testing Plan (Unit / Integration / Manual)

---

### EPIC 1: Core Orchestration Engine

#### âœ… Story 1.1: Implement Job Coordinator

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Generate job ID
- [ ] Parse and validate config
- [ ] Upload job manifest to S3

**ðŸ§ª Test Plan**:
- Unit Test: Config parser handles missing fields, bad types
- Integration: Create dummy input file and submit job
- Spoonfeeding: Check manifest appears in S3 and is correct

---

#### âœ… Story 1.2: Task/Batches Generator

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Split input
- [ ] Write batch files to S3
- [ ] Generate task manifests

**ðŸ§ª Test Plan**:
- Unit Test: Batch splitter outputs correct number of batches
- Integration: Verify that each task has an S3 file and manifest
- Spoonfeeding: Confirm correct number of batch files in UI

---

#### âœ… Story 1.3: Slurm Job Submitter

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Generate array job
- [ ] Submit with `sbatch`
- [ ] Store array ID in manifest

**ðŸ§ª Test Plan**:
- Unit Test: Generates correct `sbatch` command string
- Spoonfeeding: Dry-run to show job would submit

---

### EPIC 2: Worker Execution & Checkpointing

#### âœ… Story 2.1: Worker Execution Loop

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Load batch
- [ ] Execute handler
- [ ] Write SQLite + manifest

**ðŸ§ª Test Plan**:
- Unit Test: `handler(payload)` works with sample payload
- Integration: Run single task manually on Slurm
- Spoonfeeding: Open SQLite and check row count

---

#### âœ… Story 2.2: DynamoDB Progress Tracking

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Record task progress
- [ ] Support retries

**ðŸ§ª Test Plan**:
- Unit Test: Check Dynamo entry update logic
- Spoonfeeding: Watch progress table update during test run

---

#### âœ… Story 2.3: Result Writing to S3

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Store results
- [ ] Include hash, row count

**ðŸ§ª Test Plan**:
- Integration: Run 1â€“2 workers, inspect uploaded `.done.json`
- Spoonfeeding: Spot check S3 contents

---

### EPIC 3: Retry & Resilience

#### âœ… Story 3.1: Retry Planner

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Detect failed tasks
- [ ] Write retry batches

**ðŸ§ª Test Plan**:
- Unit Test: Parses manifests to extract failed task IDs
- Integration: Retry a small batch, confirm only failed tasks rerun

---

#### âœ… Story 3.2: Retry Tracking & Throttling

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Cap retries
- [ ] Queue to SQS

**ðŸ§ª Test Plan**:
- Unit Test: Max retry counter logic
- Integration: Retry and ensure retries don't exceed cap

---

### EPIC 4: Aggregation & Finalization

#### âœ… Story 4.1: Aggregator Logic

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Merge results
- [ ] Validate row count

**ðŸ§ª Test Plan**:
- Unit Test: Validate SQLite/Parquet reader
- Integration: Merge N tasks and confirm row sum = total

---

#### âœ… Story 4.2: Final Job Completion

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Write final manifest
- [ ] Mark job complete

**ðŸ§ª Test Plan**:
- Spoonfeeding: Trigger manually, check final status and files

---

### EPIC 5: Rate Limiting

#### âœ… Story 5.1: Token Bucket Service

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Update tokens in Dynamo
- [ ] Handle backoff

**ðŸ§ª Test Plan**:
- Unit Test: Acquire/release logic correctness
- Integration: Multiple workers under same limit

---

#### âœ… Story 5.2: Token Lease Allocation

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Coordinator lease logic
- [ ] Lease reuse

**ðŸ§ª Test Plan**:
- Unit Test: Lease bookkeeping
- Spoonfeeding: Compare lease vs actual API calls

---

### EPIC 6: Observability & Monitoring

#### âœ… Story 6.1: Per-Task Logging

**Checklist**:
- [ ] JSON logs with metadata

**ðŸ§ª Test Plan**:
- Unit Test: Logger formats properly
- Spoonfeeding: Open log in S3 and visually inspect

---

#### âœ… Story 6.2: HTML Dashboard Generator

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Render job dashboard

**ðŸ§ª Test Plan**:
- Unit Test: Dashboard builds from test JSON logs
- Spoonfeeding: Open rendered dashboard

---

#### âœ… Story 6.3: Alerting System

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Alert on anomalies

**ðŸ§ª Test Plan**:
- Integration: Simulate job stall or error spike

---

### EPIC 7: CLI & UX Tooling

#### âœ… Story 7.1: `slurmctl submit`

**ðŸ§ª Test Plan**:
- Unit Test: Config parser, ID gen
- Spoonfeeding: Run with test config, confirm job created

---

#### âœ… Story 7.2: `slurmctl status`

**ðŸ§ª Test Plan**:
