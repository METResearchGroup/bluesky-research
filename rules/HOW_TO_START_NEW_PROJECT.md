# 📦 How to Start a New Project

This agent is responsible for guiding the user through the full lifecycle of starting a new Linear project. It includes spec creation, project setup, ticket generation, and organization. Follow this exact process.

## ✅ Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. **Create a New Spec (temp_spec.md)**
- Use the prompt and structure defined in [`HOW_TO_WRITE_A_SPEC.md`](HOW_TO_WRITE_A_SPEC.md).
- Walk the user through the 5 stakeholder-aligned phases:
  - Problem definition
  - Success metrics
  - Scope boundaries
  - UX considerations
  - Technical estimability
- Once complete, save the spec to a temporary file named `temp_spec.md`


---

### 2. **Create the Linear Project**
- Use the finalized spec in `temp_spec.md` to generate a Linear **Project**.
- Follow the structure and tone from [`HOW_TO_WRITE_LINEAR_PROJECT.md`](HOW_TO_WRITE_LINEAR_PROJECT.md):
- Title (Noun + Outcome)
- Problem Statement
- Objective & Success Criteria
- Scope & Deliverables
- Timeline & Milestones
- Team & Stakeholders
- Risks & Mitigations
- Related Tickets & Projects

---

### 3. **Move the Spec into the Project Folder**
- Once the project is created, move the `temp_spec.md` file into the appropriate folder tied to the project name.
- Example:  
  ```
  projects/<project_slug>/spec.md
  ```

---

### 4. **Generate Tickets from the Spec**
- Break down the work into 1–3 starter tickets based on the spec.
- Use the structure in [`HOW_TO_WRITE_LINEAR_TICKET.md`](HOW_TO_WRITE_LINEAR_TICKET.md):
- Title
- Context & Motivation
- Functional & Non-functional Requirements
- Success Criteria
- Test Plan
- Dependencies
- Suggested Implementation Plan
- Effort Estimate
- Priority & Impact
- Acceptance Checklist
- Links & References

---

### 5. **Iterate on the Tickets**
- After tickets are created, the team can:
- Refine scope
- Add implementation notes
- Attach links to Figma, PRs, or other resources
- Use guidance from the ticket style guide to ensure tickets are atomic, testable, and complete.

---

## 🧠 Agent Tips

- Always confirm spec completeness before moving to project creation.
- Ensure each phase of the spec has been sufficiently addressed with stakeholder concerns captured.
- Use traceable file references (`HOW_TO_WRITE_A_SPEC.md`, `HOW_TO_WRITE_LINEAR_PROJECT.md`, `HOW_TO_WRITE_LINEAR_TICKET.md`) to enforce structure and quality.
