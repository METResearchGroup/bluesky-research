# Content Analysis Extension - Lessons Learned

## Project Planning Phase (2025-09-22)

### What Worked Well
1. **Iterative Specification Process**: The brain dump → spec → expert review process provided comprehensive coverage of requirements
2. **Linear Integration**: Creating tickets directly in Linear with proper descriptions and acceptance criteria
3. **Structured Approach**: Following PROJECT_PLANNING_EXECUTION_OUTLINE.md ensured nothing was missed
4. **Expert Persona Review**: Multi-perspective feedback from Academic Research Coordinator and NLP Research Specialist provided valuable insights

### Key Insights
1. **Entity Consolidation Strategy**: The lookup set approach for common entities (e.g., {donald, trump, donald trump} → "trump") is crucial for meaningful NER results
2. **Standardized Output Format**: Having consistent CSV format across all modules will greatly facilitate visualization and analysis
3. **Pre-sliced Data**: Creating pre-sliced CSV files for visualization will save significant time during analysis phase
4. **Integration with Existing Infrastructure**: Leveraging existing topic modeling data loading and stratification logic is essential for consistency

### Challenges and Solutions
1. **Scope Management**: Initially considered too many analysis types; focused on TF-IDF, NER, Hashtags, and Mentions as most relevant
2. **Entity Normalization Complexity**: Addressed through phased approach - start with basic lookup sets, iterate based on results
3. **Visualization Requirements**: Clarified need for publication-ready PNG outputs with specific chart types

### Process Improvements for Future Projects
1. **Early Stakeholder Alignment**: The expert persona review process should be standard for all research projects
2. **Technical Debt Consideration**: Always consider integration with existing systems early in planning
3. **Documentation Standards**: Establish consistent documentation patterns across all modules from the start

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **spaCy for NER**: Chosen for robust entity recognition and political/sociopolitical focus
2. **scikit-learn for TF-IDF**: Leveraging existing dependency for consistency
3. **Standardized CSV Format**: `condition | pre/post_election | entity/keyword/hashtag/mention | count | proportion`
4. **PNG Visualization Output**: For research publication compatibility

### Next Phase Preparation
- Ready to begin implementation with clear requirements and acceptance criteria
- All dependencies identified and documented
- Risk mitigation strategies in place
- Clear success metrics defined

## Implementation Phase
*To be updated as implementation progresses*
