# Planning Notes

## Bluesky Post Explorer Backend

### MET-16: Backend Project Foundation PR
- **PR:** https://github.com/METResearchGroup/bluesky-research/pull/192
- **Scope:**
  - FastAPI app scaffolded in `bluesky_database/backend/app/`
  - Minimal root endpoint implemented
  - Dockerfile (python:3.10-slim, uv for dependencies) in `Dockerfiles/`
  - `requirements.in` and `requirements.txt` for dependency tracking
  - README with setup, Docker, and environment instructions
- **Process:**
  - Followed [TASK_PLANNING_AND_PRIORITIZATION.md](../rules/TASK_PLANNING_AND_PRIORITIZATION.md) for ticket breakdown, Linear sync, and commit standards
  - Created Linear project and issues for all backend milestones
  - Used a dedicated branch and PR for MET-16, with clear commit and PR messages
  - Ensured all code is modular, documented, and ready for CI/CD

### General Planning Notes
- All backend milestones are tracked in Linear under "Bluesky Post Explorer Backend"
- Each milestone is mapped to a Linear issue and a planned PR
- Planning, implementation, and review follow the standards in `TASK_PLANNING_AND_PRIORITIZATION.md`:
  - Decompose features into granular subtasks
  - Document deliverables, dependencies, and effort
  - Sync all planning and progress with Linear and GitHub
  - Maintain high code quality, test coverage, and documentation
- Next up: MET-17 (Auth Implementation)
