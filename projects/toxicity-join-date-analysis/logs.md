# Toxicity vs Join Date Analysis - Project Logs

## 2024-12-28 - Project Setup Phase

### 14:30 - Project Planning Initiated
- Started brainstorming session for toxicity vs join date analysis
- Created comprehensive brain dump capturing all requirements and context
- Identified key stakeholders: Billy (research team), Wednesday afternoon deadline

### 15:00 - Specification Creation
- Created detailed specification following HOW_TO_WRITE_A_SPEC.md
- Walked through all 5 stakeholder-aligned phases
- Conducted multi-persona review with 5 specialized personas:
  - Social Science Research Expert (Score: 26/35)
  - Exploratory Analysis Expert (Score: 30/35)
  - API Integration Expert (Score: 26/35)
  - Scientific Visualization Specialist (Score: 30/35)
  - Data Quality Research Expert (Score: 24/35)

### 15:30 - Linear Project Creation
- Created Linear project definition following HOW_TO_WRITE_LINEAR_PROJECT.md
- Generated comprehensive implementation ticket following HOW_TO_WRITE_LINEAR_TICKET.md
- Set up project organization structure with proper file hierarchy

### 16:00 - GitHub Operations
- Created feature branch: feature/toxicity_join_date_analysis_setup
- Committed project files with descriptive commit message
- Pushed branch to remote repository successfully
- Created PR #217 with comprehensive description and proper labels

### 16:15 - Project Tracking Setup
- Created project tracking files:
  - plan_toxicity_analysis.md - Project plan with subtasks and effort estimates
  - todo.md - Checklist synchronized with Linear ticket
  - logs.md - This log file for tracking progress and issues

## Project Status
- **Current Phase**: Project setup complete, awaiting PR review
- **Next Phase**: Implementation following ticket-001.md
- **Deadline**: Wednesday afternoon
- **PR Status**: Open, needs review (https://github.com/METResearchGroup/bluesky-research/pull/217)

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Single Ticket Approach**: User requested single comprehensive ticket instead of multiple tickets
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Focus on exploratory analysis rather than statistical significance testing
3. **Existing Infrastructure**: Leverage existing Bluesky API integration and Perspective API data
4. **Visualization Requirements**: Histogram and scatterplot for research presentation

## Risks Identified
- Bluesky API rate limits may constrain sample size
- Sampling bias toward active users in database
- Data quality issues (missing join dates, insufficient posts)
- Wednesday afternoon deadline creates time pressure

## Mitigation Strategies
- Use existing rate limit handling code
- Document sampling limitations in analysis
- Implement data quality validation throughout pipeline
- Focus on streamlined approach with existing infrastructure
