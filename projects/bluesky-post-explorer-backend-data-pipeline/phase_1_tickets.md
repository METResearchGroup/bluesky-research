## MET-001: Set up Redis container with Docker and basic monitoring

### Context & Motivation
Redis buffer is required for high-throughput data buffering to handle ~8.1M events/day from the Bluesky firehose. This is the foundation for the entire data pipeline and must be operational before any data processing can begin. We need Redis running with Prometheus/Grafana monitoring from day one for visibility into system performance.

### Detailed Description & Requirements

#### Functional Requirements:
- Create Dockerfile for Redis container optimized for high-throughput buffering
- Configure Redis with appropriate memory settings for ~8.1M events/day
- Set up Redis persistence strategy (RDB + AOF) for data recovery
- Implement basic Redis configuration for performance optimization
- Create Docker Compose service definition for Redis
- Set up Prometheus Redis exporter for metrics collection
- Configure Grafana dashboard for Redis monitoring
- Implement basic health check endpoint for Redis

#### Non-Functional Requirements:
- Redis must handle 1000+ operations/second sustained
- Memory usage should not exceed 80% of allocated RAM
- Container should start within 30 seconds
- Redis should be accessible on standard port 6379
- Prometheus metrics should be available within 60 seconds of container start
- Grafana dashboard should show key Redis metrics (memory, ops/sec, connected clients)

#### Validation & Error Handling:
- Redis container starts successfully on first attempt
- Redis responds to PING commands within 100ms
- Container logs show successful startup without errors
- Memory usage stays within acceptable bounds during testing
- Prometheus can scrape Redis metrics
- Grafana dashboard displays Redis metrics correctly

### Success Criteria
- Redis container starts successfully with Docker Compose
- Redis responds to basic commands (PING, INFO, etc.)
- Container logs show no errors during startup
- Redis configuration optimized for high-throughput operations
- Prometheus Redis exporter running and collecting metrics
- Grafana dashboard showing Redis performance metrics
- Basic health check endpoint returns 200 OK
- Docker Compose file committed to repository

### Test Plan
