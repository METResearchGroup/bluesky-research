# Lessons Learned: Feed-Level Topic Analysis

## Project Planning Phase

### Specification Development
- **Success**: Multi-phase specification process with persona reviews provided excellent validation
- **Insight**: BERT Topic Modeling Expert and Exploratory Analysis Expert provided complementary perspectives
- **Process Improvement**: The 5-phase specification approach (problem → success → scope → UX → technical) ensured comprehensive coverage

### Persona Review Process  
- **BERT Topic Modeling Expert Feedback**:
  - ✅ Identified need for specific Sentence Transformer model selection
  - ✅ Highlighted importance of coherence metrics monitoring
  - ✅ Validated technical approach as methodologically sound
- **Exploratory Analysis Expert Feedback**:
  - ✅ Confirmed systematic stratification approach as exemplary for EDA
  - ✅ Validated focus on descriptive over inferential statistics
  - ✅ Endorsed multi-level analysis design

### Linear Project Setup
- **Success**: Clear ticket breakdown with proper dependencies identified
- **Challenge**: All tickets are sequential (no parallel execution opportunities)
- **Decision**: Prioritized modular design to enable future parallel development

### Technical Architecture Decisions
- **Generic Pipeline Design**: Separation of BERTopic wrapper from feed-specific analysis enables reusability
- **YAML Configuration**: Comprehensive parameter management approach validated by experts
- **GPU Optimization**: Early consideration of scalability for 1M posts

## Estimation Accuracy
- **Planning Effort**: 6 hours for initial braindump → specification → Linear setup
- **Ticket Breakdown**: 28 total hours (20 core + 8 optional)
- **Critical Path**: 20 hours for research-essential components

## Process Insights
- **Braindump → Specification → Persona Review** workflow effectively captured requirements
- **Systematic stratification approach** (overall → condition → time → condition×time) validated as comprehensive
- **Research focus on EDA over inferential testing** appropriate for exploratory goals

## Future Project Considerations
- **Persona Reviews**: Highly valuable for technical validation, recommend for complex projects
- **Modular Architecture**: Generic + specific code separation enables reusability
- **Documentation Standards**: Comprehensive tracking files support project transparency

## Risk Mitigation Effectiveness
- **BERTopic Scalability**: GPU access and expert validation provide confidence
- **Topic Quality**: Coherence metrics monitoring addresses interpretability concerns
- **Scope Management**: Clear in/out scope boundaries prevent feature creep
