# Project Todo: Feed-Level Topic Analysis for Bluesky Research

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] **MET-34**: Core BERTopic pipeline with YAML configuration and text preprocessing ✅ COMPLETED
  - Generic, reusable BERTopic wrapper with quality monitoring
  - GPU optimization and comprehensive testing
  - YAML configuration for all parameters

## Phase 2: Data Loading Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] **MET-44**: Implement Local Data Loader for Topic Modeling Pipeline ✅ COMPLETED
  - **V2 Approach (Current)**: Simplified, direct implementation for research workflow
    - 3 files, 241 lines total (90%+ complexity reduction)
    - Direct function calls, no unnecessary abstractions
    - Fast iteration and testing of BERTopic logic
    - Immediate working solution for local data analysis
  - **V1 Approach (Previous)**: Enterprise-grade pipeline with 20+ files, 2600+ lines
    - Abstract DataLoader interface with multiple implementations
    - Configuration-driven data loader selection
    - Comprehensive testing suite and pipeline orchestration
    - Over-engineered for actual research needs
  - **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - V2 simplified approach implemented and working
  - **Actual Effort**: ~2 hours (vs. estimated 4+ hours for V1)
  - **Dependencies**: ✅ MET-34 (Core BERTopic pipeline) COMPLETED

- [ ] **MET-45**: Implement Production Data Loader for Topic Modeling Pipeline
  - ProductionDataLoader implementation following DataLoader interface
  - Production data source integration with robust error handling
  - Performance optimization for production-scale data loading
  - Production configuration management
  - **Dependencies**: MET-44 (Local Data Loader) ✅ COMPLETED

## Phase 3: Analysis & Stratification

- [ ] **MET-46**: Implement Feed-Specific Analysis and Stratification for Topic Models
  - Multi-level stratified analysis (overall → condition → time → condition×time)
  - Topic evolution tracking across 2-month experimental period
  - Topic co-occurrence patterns within feeds
  - Weekly temporal analysis and pre/post election comparison
  - Publication-ready visualizations and statistical summaries
  - **Dependencies**: MET-44, MET-45 (Data Loading Infrastructure)

## Phase 4: Publication & Documentation

- [ ] **Publication Materials Generation**
  - Statistical tables and publication-quality figures
  - Topic evolution and co-occurrence analysis reports
  - Reproducible analysis pipeline documentation
  - **Dependencies**: MET-46 (Feed-Specific Analysis)

- [ ] **Final Documentation & Handoff**
  - Complete pipeline documentation
  - Usage examples and best practices
  - Performance benchmarks and optimization notes
  - **Dependencies**: All previous phases

## Implementation Notes

### MET-44 Implementation (V2 - Current)
- **Package Structure**: `services/calculate_analytics/analyses/calculate_feed_topic_models_2025_08_18/`
- **Core Components**: Simple DataLoader class, direct BERTopic execution, CSV export
- **Integration**: Direct integration with existing BERTopicWrapper from MET-34
- **Testing**: Working script ready for immediate use
- **Deliverables**: ✅ Working topic modeling script for local data analysis

### V2 vs V1 Approach Benefits
- **Complexity Reduction**: 90%+ reduction in code and files
- **Development Speed**: Working solution in 2 hours vs. 20+ hours for V1
- **Maintenance**: Minimal overhead, easy to understand and modify
- **Research Workflow**: Fast iteration, direct execution, immediate results
- **YAGNI Principle**: Only builds what's actually needed

### Next Steps After MET-44
1. **MET-45**: Production data loader implementation (if needed)
2. **MET-46**: Feed-specific analysis and stratification
3. **Publication Materials**: Statistical analysis and visualizations

## Current Status: Week 2 - Data Loading Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED
**Focus**: ✅ COMPLETED - Simplified data loading infrastructure implemented and working.
**Next Focus**: Move to Phase 3 - Analysis & Stratification (MET-46)
