# Analytics System Refactor - Task Plan

## Project Overview
Refactor the `services/calculate_analytics/` system from monolithic scripts to simple, consistent patterns using modular components.

## Subtasks and Deliverables

### Phase 1: Extract Shared Data Loading & Processing (Week 1)
**Effort**: 1 week (1 developer)

#### Subtasks:
1. **Create shared data loading modules**
   - Extract post loading logic from `load_data.py`
   - Extract label loading logic from `load_labels.py`
   - Extract feed loading logic from `load_feeds.py`
   - Extract user loading logic from participant data modules

2. **Create shared processing modules**
   - Extract feature calculation logic from `feed_analytics.py`
   - Extract threshold calculation logic from `weekly_thresholds.py`
   - Extract engagement analysis logic from engagement scripts

3. **Create shared configuration management**
   - Extract constants to YAML configuration files
   - Create configuration loading and validation utilities
   - Implement environment-specific configuration support

#### Deliverables:
- `shared/data_loading/` directory with focused modules
- `shared/processing/` directory with reusable processing functions
- `shared/config/` directory with configuration management
- All existing scripts updated to import from shared modules

#### Success Criteria:
- [ ] All existing scripts still work after refactoring
- [ ] No code duplication between shared modules
- [ ] Configuration externalized from hardcoded values

### Phase 2: Implement Simple Pipeline Framework (Week 2)
**Effort**: 1 week (1 developer)

#### Subtasks:
1. **Create base pipeline ABCs**
   - Implement `BaseResearchPipeline` abstract base class
   - Implement `BaseFeedAnalysisPipeline` abstract base class
   - Define clear interfaces for data loading, processing, and output generation

2. **Refactor core analytics into pipelines**
   - Convert feed analytics to concrete pipeline implementation
   - Convert weekly thresholds to concrete pipeline implementation
   - Convert engagement analysis to concrete pipeline implementation

3. **Implement simple pipeline execution patterns**
   - Add basic pipeline state management
   - Implement error handling and recovery
   - Add logging and progress tracking

#### Deliverables:
- Simple pipeline framework in `shared/pipelines/`
- Concrete pipeline implementations for existing analytics
- Consistent patterns for one-off research analyses

#### Success Criteria:
- [ ] All existing analytics can be run through pipeline framework
- [ ] Pipeline tests pass independently
- [ ] Performance meets or exceeds current benchmarks

### Phase 3: Reorganize One-Off Analyses (Week 3)
**Effort**: 1 week (1 developer)

#### Subtasks:
1. **Create analysis folder structure**
   - Create `analyses/` directory with proper structure
   - Move existing analysis scripts to appropriate dated folders
   - Implement one analysis per folder structure

2. **Update analysis scripts**
   - Modify analysis scripts to use shared modules
   - Update imports and dependencies
   - Ensure all analyses can be re-run successfully

3. **Standardize analysis folder contents**
   - Add `README.md` to each analysis folder
   - Create `investigation.ipynb` for exploratory work
   - Organize `assets/` folder for outputs

#### Deliverables:
- Organized analysis folders with consistent structure
- Updated analysis scripts using shared modules
- Standardized documentation and organization

#### Success Criteria:
- [ ] All analyses moved to focused, dated folders
- [ ] Each analysis folder contains required components
- [ ] All analyses can be re-run with identical outputs

### Phase 4: Implement Testing & Validation (Week 4)
**Effort**: 1 week (1 developer)

#### Subtasks:
1. **Create comprehensive test suite**
   - Unit tests for all shared modules
   - Integration tests for pipeline framework
   - Regression tests for output consistency

2. **Implement data validation**
   - Input validation for all data loading functions
   - Output validation for all processing functions
   - Data quality checks and monitoring

3. **Performance testing and optimization**
   - Benchmark current performance
   - Implement caching and optimization
   - Validate performance improvements

#### Deliverables:
- Comprehensive test suite with >80% coverage
- Data validation and quality monitoring
- Performance benchmarks and optimization

#### Success Criteria:
- [ ] >80% test coverage achieved
- [ ] All tests pass consistently
- [ ] Performance targets met or exceeded

### Phase 5: Documentation & Cleanup (Week 5)
**Effort**: 1 week (1 developer)

#### Subtasks:
1. **Update documentation**
   - Comprehensive README for shared modules
   - Usage examples and tutorials
   - Migration guide for existing users

2. **Clean up old files**
   - Remove deprecated monolithic scripts
   - Clean up unused imports and dependencies
   - Archive old analysis outputs

3. **Final validation**
   - End-to-end testing of complete system
   - Validation of all outputs and functionality
   - Performance and reliability verification

#### Deliverables:
- Complete documentation for refactored system
- Clean, maintainable codebase
- Final validation and testing results

#### Success Criteria:
- [ ] All documentation updated and comprehensive
- [ ] Old monolithic scripts removed
- [ ] Final validation completed successfully

## Dependencies and Parallel Execution

### Phase Dependencies:
- Phase 2 depends on Phase 1 completion
- Phase 3 depends on Phase 2 completion
- Phase 4 depends on Phase 3 completion
- Phase 5 depends on Phase 4 completion

### Parallel Execution Opportunities:
- Documentation writing can begin during implementation
- Testing can be developed alongside implementation
- Configuration management can be developed independently

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas:
1. **Output Compatibility**: Maintain exact CSV outputs during refactoring
2. **Performance Regression**: Ensure refactoring doesn't degrade performance
3. **Integration Complexity**: Manage dependencies between shared modules

### Mitigation Strategies:
1. **Incremental Approach**: Small, testable changes with validation at each step
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Regression tests ensure output consistency
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous benchmarking during refactoring
4. **Rollback Plan**: Ability to revert to previous version if issues arise

## Success Metrics

### Code Quality:
- Test coverage >80% across all shared functionality
- Code duplication reduced by >50%
- No single file >500 lines
- All public functions documented

### Performance:
- Processing time reduced by >40% through caching and optimization
- Memory usage reduced by >30%
- <1% error rate in data processing

### Maintainability:
- Clear separation of concerns between shared and analysis code
- Consistent pipeline structure across all analyses
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
