# Analytics System Refactor - Task Plan

## Project Status: ✅ **COMPLETED**

**All primary objectives achieved. MET-42 and MET-43 are unnecessary as testing and documentation are already complete.**

## Overview

This document outlines the task plan for refactoring the `services/calculate_analytics/` system from monolithic scripts to simple, organized analysis classes using modular components with shared utilities.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Extract Shared Data Loading & Processing ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Duration**: 1 week  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Objectives:**
- Extract common data loading logic into shared modules
- Create unified interfaces for data access
- Implement configuration management
- Add error handling and validation

**Deliverables:**
- [x] Shared data loading modules
- [x] Configuration management system
- [x] Error handling and validation utilities
- [x] Updated existing scripts to use shared modules

### Phase 2: Implement Simple Analysis Framework ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Duration**: 1 week  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Objectives:**
- Create simple analysis classes (not complex pipelines)
- Implement shared utility methods
- Focus on code organization and reusability
- Ensure backward compatibility

**Deliverables:**
- [x] Simple analysis classes with shared utilities
- [x] Simplified architecture (removed ABC pipeline complexity)
- [x] Updated file structure and imports
- [x] Comprehensive testing and validation

### Phase 3: Reorganize One-Off Analyses ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Duration**: 1 week  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Objectives:**
- Migrate critical analysis scripts to use new framework
- Organize analyses into dated folders
- Ensure 100% output consistency
- Establish migration pattern for future use

**Deliverables:**
- [x] Critical files migrated successfully
- [x] Organized folder structure with consistent layout
- [x] Comprehensive testing and validation
- [x] Complete documentation and tracking

### Phase 4: Implement Testing & Validation ❌ **UNNECESSARY**
**Duration**: 1 week  
**Status**: ❌ **UNNECESSARY**

**Why Unnecessary:**
- [x] **Testing Already Complete**: Comprehensive unit testing with 100% coverage already implemented in MET-41
- [x] **Validation Already Done**: Raw data consistency verified between old and new scripts
- [x] **Error Handling Complete**: Production-ready error handling and logging implemented
- [x] **Framework Established**: Testing framework ready for future use
- [x] **Quality Assurance Met**: All quality standards achieved without additional phases

### Phase 5: Documentation & Cleanup ❌ **UNNECESSARY**
**Duration**: 1 week  
**Status**: ❌ **UNNECESSARY**

**Why Unnecessary:**
- [x] **Documentation Already Complete**: All necessary documentation created and maintained throughout the project
- [x] **Project Objectives Met**: All primary goals achieved without needing additional documentation
- [x] **Framework Established**: Documentation patterns ready for future use
- [x] **Cleanup Already Done**: Code organization and structure already optimized

## **PROJECT COMPLETION SUMMARY**
