# Analytics System Refactor - Todo Checklist

## Phase 1: Extract Shared Data Loading & Processing (Week 1)

> **Status**: Implementation Plan Created  
> **Linear Issue**: [MET-39](https://linear.app/metresearch/issue/MET-39/phase-1-extract-shared-data-loading-and-processing)  
> **Implementation Plan**: [plan_phase1_implementation.md](plan_phase1_implementation.md)

### Data Loading Modules
- [x] Create `shared/data_loading/` directory
- [x] Extract post loading logic from `load_data.py`
- [x] Extract label loading logic from `load_labels.py`
- [x] Extract feed loading logic from `load_feeds.py`
- [x] Extract user loading logic from participant data modules
- [x] Test all data loading modules independently

### Processing Modules
- [ ] Create `shared/processing/` directory
- [ ] Extract feature calculation logic from `feed_analytics.py`
- [ ] Extract threshold calculation logic from `weekly_thresholds.py`
- [ ] Extract engagement analysis logic from engagement scripts
- [ ] Test all processing modules independently

### Configuration Management
- [x] Create `shared/config/` directory
- [x] Extract constants to YAML configuration files
- [x] Create configuration loading and validation utilities
- [x] Implement environment-specific configuration support
- [x] Test configuration management system

### Integration
- [ ] Update all existing scripts to import from shared modules
- [ ] Verify all existing scripts still work after refactoring
- [ ] Ensure no code duplication between shared modules
- [ ] Validate configuration externalization

## Phase 2: Implement ABC-Based Pipeline Framework (Week 2)

### Base Pipeline ABCs
- [ ] Create `shared/pipelines/` directory
- [ ] Implement `BaseResearchPipeline` abstract base class
- [ ] Implement `BaseFeedAnalysisPipeline` abstract base class
- [ ] Define clear interfaces for data loading, processing, and output generation
- [ ] Test base pipeline ABCs

### Concrete Pipeline Implementations
- [ ] Convert feed analytics to concrete pipeline implementation
- [ ] Convert weekly thresholds to concrete pipeline implementation
- [ ] Convert engagement analysis to concrete pipeline implementation
- [ ] Test all concrete pipeline implementations

### Pipeline Orchestration
- [ ] Add basic pipeline state management
- [ ] Implement error handling and recovery
- [ ] Add logging and progress tracking
- [ ] Test pipeline orchestration

### Validation
- [ ] Verify all existing analytics can be run through pipeline framework
- [ ] Ensure pipeline tests pass independently
- [ ] Validate performance meets or exceeds current benchmarks

## Phase 3: Reorganize One-Off Analyses (Week 3)

### Analysis Folder Structure
- [ ] Create `analyses/` directory with proper structure
- [ ] Move existing analysis scripts to appropriate dated folders
- [ ] Implement one analysis per folder structure
- [ ] Validate folder organization

### Analysis Script Updates
- [ ] Modify analysis scripts to use shared modules
- [ ] Update imports and dependencies
- [ ] Ensure all analyses can be re-run successfully
- [ ] Test all updated analysis scripts

### Standardization
- [ ] Add `README.md` to each analysis folder
- [ ] Create `investigation.ipynb` for exploratory work
- [ ] Organize `assets/` folder for outputs
- [ ] Validate standardized structure

### Final Validation
- [ ] Verify all analyses moved to focused, dated folders
- [ ] Ensure each analysis folder contains required components
- [ ] Confirm all analyses can be re-run with identical outputs

## Phase 4: Implement Testing & Validation (Week 4)

### Test Suite Creation
- [ ] Create unit tests for all shared modules
- [ ] Create integration tests for pipeline framework
- [ ] Create regression tests for output consistency
- [ ] Achieve >80% test coverage

### Data Validation
- [ ] Implement input validation for all data loading functions
- [ ] Implement output validation for all processing functions
- [ ] Add data quality checks and monitoring
- [ ] Test validation systems

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Benchmark current performance
- [ ] Implement caching and optimization
- [ ] Validate performance improvements
- [ ] Document performance metrics

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass consistently
- [ ] Validate performance targets met or exceeded
- [ ] Verify data quality monitoring works correctly

## Phase 5: Documentation & Cleanup (Week 5)

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Create comprehensive README for shared modules
- [ ] Write usage examples and tutorials
- [ ] Create migration guide for existing users
- [ ] Review and finalize all documentation

### Code Cleanup
- [ ] Remove deprecated monolithic scripts
- [ ] Clean up unused imports and dependencies
- [ ] Archive old analysis outputs
- [ ] Validate clean codebase

### Final Validation
- [ ] Conduct end-to-end testing of complete system
- [ ] Validate all outputs and functionality
- [ ] Verify performance and reliability
- [ ] Complete final testing checklist

### Project Completion
- [ ] Review all success criteria
- [ ] Validate all deliverables completed
- [ ] Final code review and approval
- [ ] Project handoff and documentation

## Notes
- Each checkbox corresponds to a Linear issue
- Update checkboxes as Linear issues are completed
- Use this checklist for daily progress tracking
- Mark items as blocked if dependencies are not met
