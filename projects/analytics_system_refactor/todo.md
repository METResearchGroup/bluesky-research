- [x] **REVISED**: Validate that simplified architecture maintains functionality

### **IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS FOR SIMPLIFIED ARCHITECTURE**

#### Step 1: Create Simplified Base Class

#### Step 2: Simplify Analysis Classes
- [x] **NEW**: Convert FeedAnalysisPipeline to FeedAnalyzer
- [x] **NEW**: Convert EngagementAnalysisPipeline to EngagementAnalyzer
- [x] **NEW**: Convert WeeklyThresholdsPipeline to WeeklyThresholdsAnalyzer
- [x] **NEW**: Replace pipeline lifecycle with direct method execution
- [x] **NEW**: Implement simple methods like analyze_partition_date() instead of complex orchestration

#### Step 3: Update File Structure
- [x] **NEW**: Rename pipelines/ directory to analyzers/
- [x] **NEW**: Update all import statements throughout codebase
- [x] **NEW**: Remove old pipeline framework files
- [x] **NEW**: Update __init__.py files with new class names

#### Step 4: Update Usage Patterns
- [x] **NEW**: Replace complex pipeline.run() calls with direct method calls
- [x] **NEW**: Update example_usage.py to demonstrate simplified approach
- [x] **NEW**: Update all existing scripts to use new analyzer classes
- [x] **NEW**: Ensure backward compatibility during transition

#### Step 5: Testing & Validation
- [x] **NEW**: Test simplified analyzer classes independently
- [x] **NEW**: Verify all functionality preserved from pipeline framework
- [x] **NEW**: Ensure performance meets or exceeds current benchmarks
- [x] **NEW**: Validate that simplified architecture maintains functionality

## Phase 3: Reorganize One-Off Analyses ✅ **COMPLETED**
