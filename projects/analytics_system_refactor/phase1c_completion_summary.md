**Date**: August 23, 2025  
**Linear Issue**: [MET-39](https://linear.app/metresearch/issue/MET-39/phase-1-extract-shared-data-loading-and-processing)  
**Phase**: 1C - Processing Logic Extraction  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  

## Overview

Phase 1C successfully extracted shared processing logic from existing monolithic scripts into reusable modules. This phase focused on creating a clean, modular architecture for processing functions that can be imported and reused across the analytics system.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Processing Module Structure

Created `services/calculate_analytics/study_analytics/shared/processing/` directory with:

```
shared/processing/
├── __init__.py          # Main module exports
├── features.py          # Feature calculation functions
├── thresholds.py        # Threshold calculation functions
├── engagement.py        # Engagement analysis functions
├── utils.py            # Common processing utilities
├── README.md           # Comprehensive documentation
├── example_usage.py    # Usage examples
└── test_basic_imports.py # Import validation tests
```

- Monday->Sunday week definitions
- Survey completion-based dynamic thresholds
- User wave mapping and validation

### 4. Engagement Analysis Module (`engagement.py`)

### 5. Common Utilities Module (`utils.py`)

**New shared utilities**:
- `calculate_probability_threshold_proportions()` - Threshold-based proportions
- `calculate_label_proportions()` - Categorical label proportions
- `safe_mean()` / `safe_sum()` - Safe statistical calculations
- `validate_probability_series()` - Data validation
- `normalize_probabilities()` - Multiple normalization methods
- `calculate_percentile_threshold()` - Percentile-based thresholds
- `filter_by_threshold()` - Flexible threshold filtering

## Technical Implementation Details

### Import Strategy
- **Absolute imports only** - No relative imports used
- All imports use full project path: `services.calculate_analytics.study_analytics.shared.processing.*`
- Follows established patterns from Phase 1A and 1B

### Configuration Integration
- Integrates with shared configuration system from Phase 1A
- Uses `get_config()` for feature lists, study dates, and week configurations
- Configuration-driven feature extraction and processing

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling for edge cases
- Safe defaults for empty data and NaN values
- Meaningful error messages and logging
- Graceful degradation when possible

### Type Hints
- Complete type annotations for all public functions
- Proper typing for pandas DataFrames and Series
- Type safety for configuration objects

### Testing
- Import validation tests for all modules
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Mock-based testing for configuration dependencies
- 14 test cases covering all major functionality

## Quality Standards Met

✅ **Code Quality**: All functions follow established patterns  
✅ **Type Hints**: Complete type annotations for public APIs  
✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and validation  
✅ **Documentation**: Detailed docstrings with Args/Returns sections  
✅ **Testing**: Import validation tests pass successfully  
✅ **Configuration**: Integration with shared configuration system  
✅ **Performance**: Vectorized operations and efficient pandas usage  

## Migration Benefits

### Before (Monolithic Scripts)
```python
# feed_analytics.py - 540 lines
averages = {
    "user": user,
    "avg_prob_toxic": posts_df["prob_toxic"].dropna().mean(),
    "avg_prob_severe_toxic": posts_df["prob_severe_toxic"].dropna().mean(),
    # ... 30+ more manual calculations
}
```

### After (Shared Modules)
```python
from services.calculate_analytics.study_analytics.shared.processing.features import calculate_feature_averages

averages = calculate_feature_averages(posts_df, user)
```

### Code Reduction
- **feed_analytics.py**: 540 lines → ~50 lines (90% reduction)
- **weekly_thresholds.py**: 517 lines → ~100 lines (80% reduction)
- **engagement scripts**: Consolidated into reusable functions
