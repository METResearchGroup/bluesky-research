# Analytics System Refactor

## Project Overview
Refactor the `services/calculate_analytics/` system from monolithic scripts to simple, organized analysis classes using modular components with shared utilities.

## Project Status
**Current Phase**: Phase 1 Complete, Phase 2 Planning  
**Overall Progress**: 25%  
**Next Milestone**: Begin Phase 2 Implementation (Simple Analysis Framework)  
**Risk Level**: Low (Simplified architecture reduces complexity)

## **ARCHITECTURE REVISION - KEY CHANGES**

### **Original Plan vs. Revised Approach**

**Original Architecture (ABC Pipeline Framework):**
- Complex abstract base classes with setup/execute lifecycle
- Pipeline state management and orchestration
- Enterprise software engineering patterns
- Over-engineered for research needs

**Revised Architecture (Simple Analysis Classes):**
- Simple classes with inheritance for shared utilities
- Direct method execution without complex lifecycle
- Research-focused patterns for transparency and reproducibility
- Focus on code organization and reusability

### **Why the Architecture Was Simplified**

**Academic Research Requirements:**
- **Transparency**: Code must be easy to understand for peer reviewers
- **Reproducibility**: Results must be identical every time
- **Simplicity**: Research is iterative and stateless
- **Academic Scrutiny**: Nature-level papers require clear, maintainable code

**Research Workflow Alignment:**
- **One-off execution**: Run analyses, not orchestrate workflows
- **Iterative development**: Modify and rerun, not maintain long-running processes
- **Stateless operation**: No need for pipeline state management
- **Direct execution**: Simple method calls are better than complex interfaces

**Code Organization Benefits:**
- **Shared utilities**: Common functionality through simple inheritance
- **Clear responsibility**: Each class has single, obvious purpose
- **Easy testing**: Simple unit tests without complex mocking
- **Maintainability**: Less code to maintain and debug

## Analysis Folder Structure

Each analysis folder follows a consistent structure to ensure clarity and reproducibility:

```
analyses/
â”œâ”€â”€ feed_content_analysis_2024_12_01/           # One analysis per folder
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                     # Description of analysis purpose and methodology
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ investigation.ipynb           # Jupyter notebook with preliminary investigation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.py                       # Main implementation generating analytical assets
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ assets/                       # Generated outputs (CSV files, images, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ user_engagement_analysis_2024_12_01/     # Another distinct analysis
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ investigation.ipynb
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ assets/
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

**Folder Naming Convention**: `<description>_<YYYY_MM_DD>` where description is a brief, clear name for the specific analysis being performed. This format ensures valid Python import paths.

## Success Criteria
- All existing analytics outputs can be reproduced exactly
- New analyses can be created quickly using shared modules
- Codebase is maintainable with clear separation of concerns
- Performance improved through better caching and optimization
- System is extensible for future research needs
- **NEW**: Code is transparent and easy to understand for peer reviewers
- **NEW**: Architecture supports academic rigor and reproducibility

## Key Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: >80% (Target)
- **Code Duplication**: Reduce by >50% (Target)
- **Performance**: >40% faster processing (Target)
- **File Size**: No files >500 lines (Target)
- **Architecture Complexity**: Simplified from ABC pipelines to simple classes (Target)

## Team
- **Lead Developer**: [TBD]
- **Reviewers**: [TBD]
- **Stakeholders**: Research team, data engineers

## Notes
- This project maintains backward compatibility throughout refactoring
- All changes are incremental and testable
- Focus is on research-grade reliability and reproducibility, not production complexity
- **REVISED**: Simple, organized patterns provide consistency while maintaining flexibility
- **REVISED**: Architecture better aligns with academic research requirements and peer review scrutiny
- **REVISED**: Removed unnecessary enterprise complexity in favor of research-focused simplicity
