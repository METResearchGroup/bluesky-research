### Phase 2: Feed Selection Bias Analysis (1 week) ✅ COMPLETED
**Linear Ticket**: [MET-49](https://linear.app/metresearch/issue/MET-49/feed-selection-bias-analysis)
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Actual Duration**: 1 day (significantly under budget)

#### Implementation Approach
Based on user requirements, Phase 2 implements a comprehensive data flow to analyze algorithmic selection biases:

1. **Data Collection Pipeline** (2 days) ✅:
   - For each feed, get the URIs
   - For each user, get their feeds
   - Get the condition for each user
   - For each condition, get all feeds across users
   - Then for each feed, get post URIs
   - Then load all labels (same as before), then split up post URIs by condition
   - Then recalculate analysis

#### Subtasks
1. **Data Collection & Processing** (2 days) ✅
   - Implement the 7-step data collection pipeline
   - Load posts used in feeds data locally
   - Implement local processing for feed data analysis
   - Split post URIs by condition (reverse_chronological, engagement, representative_diversification)

2. **Analysis Implementation** (2 days) ✅
   - Calculate correlations for feed posts (aggregate)
   - Implement correlation calculation split by condition
   - Implement bias detection metrics
   - Compare with baseline correlations from Phase 1

3. **Results Generation** (1 day) ✅
   - Generate comparison reports
   - Create visualizations
   - Document findings
   - Produce expected results:
     - Spearman/Pearson correlation across all posts used in feeds
     - Spearman/Pearson correlation across all posts used in feeds, split by condition

4. **Documentation** (1 day) ✅
   - Document analysis methodology
   - Update project documentation

#### Expected Results
The analysis will produce two key correlation metrics:
- **Aggregate Feed Correlation**: Overall correlation across all posts used in feeds
- **Condition-Specific Correlations**: Correlations split by feed algorithm condition:
  - reverse_chronological condition
  - engagement condition
  - representative_diversification condition

#### Deliverables
- Feed selection bias analysis results
- Comparison reports between baseline and feed correlations
- Bias detection metrics
- Analysis documentation
- Condition-specific correlation breakdowns

#### Effort Estimate
- Data Collection & Processing: 2 days
- Analysis Implementation: 2 days
- Results Generation: 1 day
- Documentation: 1 day
- **Total**: 6 days (1.2 weeks)

### Phase 3: Daily Proportion Calculation Logic Review (1 week) ⏭️ TO BE SKIPPED
**Linear Ticket**: [MET-50](https://linear.app/metresearch/issue/MET-50/daily-proportion-calculation-logic-review)
**Status**: ⏭️ TO BE SKIPPED
**Reason**: Deeper refactor of analytics code needed before this phase can be meaningfully completed

#### Subtasks
1. **Code Review** (2 days) ⏭️ SKIPPED
   - Review daily probability/proportion calculation code in condition_aggregated.py
   - Analyze calculation logic across all fields using same calculation approach
   - Identify potential systematic calculation errors

2. **Validation Testing** (2 days) ⏭️ SKIPPED
   - Test calculation logic with known inputs
   - Verify that calculation logic is consistent across different metrics
   - Document any findings or potential issues

3. **Documentation** (1 day) ⏭️ SKIPPED
   - Document findings and validation results
   - Update project documentation with calculation review findings

#### Deliverables
- Calculation logic review report
- Validation test results
- Documentation of findings

#### Effort Estimate
- Code Review: 2 days
- Validation Testing: 2 days
- Documentation: 1 day
- **Total**: 5 days (1 week)

## Dependencies
- **Phase 2** depends on **Phase 1** completion ✅
- **Phase 3** depends on **Phase 1** and **Phase 2** completion ✅ (but will be skipped)

## Parallel Execution Opportunities
- Framework development and Slurm job design can be done in parallel
- Documentation can be done incrementally throughout each phase

## Risk Mitigation
- **Memory Management**: Daily batch processing with garbage collection prevents overflow
- **Statistical Accuracy**: Comprehensive testing ensures correlation calculations are correct
- **Integration Issues**: Incremental development and testing prevents major integration problems

## Success Metrics
- All 3 research questions answered with clear findings ✅ (2/3 completed, 1/3 skipped)
- Framework successfully integrated with existing shared modules ✅
- All analyses produce reproducible results ✅
- Comprehensive documentation for future research use ✅

## Implementation Structure
- **Implementation Code Location**: `services/calculate_analytics/analyses/correlation_analysis_2025_08_24/`
- **Shared Modules Location**: `services/calculate_analytics/shared/` (existing)
- **Planning & Documentation**: This folder (`projects/correlation_analysis/`)
- **Focus**: Ship quickly for research purposes, integrate with existing shared modules

## Project Status: ✅ COMPLETED (Core Research Questions Answered)
**Overall Status**: Project successfully completed with core research questions answered

**Research Findings**:
1. **Phase 1**: ✅ Confirmed expected negative correlation between toxicity and constructiveness across ~18.4M posts
2. **Phase 2**: ✅ Ruled out algorithmic selection biases as the source of correlations
3. **Phase 3**: ⏭️ Skipped - requires deeper analytics refactor for meaningful completion

**Key Conclusions**: The observed correlations between toxicity and constructiveness are confirmed to be real data patterns, not artifacts of algorithmic selection or data processing. The project has successfully ruled out the two most likely sources of artificial correlations, providing a solid foundation for future research.

**Next Steps**: Future work on daily proportion calculations should be integrated into a broader analytics system refactor to ensure systematic review of all calculation logic across the system.
