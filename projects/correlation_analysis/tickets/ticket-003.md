# Ticket 003: Daily Proportion Calculation Logic Review

**Linear Issue**: [MET-50](https://linear.app/metresearch/issue/MET-50/daily-proportion-calculation-logic-review)

## Research Question
"Assuming the above two check out, review the logic for calculating the daily probability/proportion checks. I'd be surprised if it were at this step, mostly because the problem would be more systematic since I use the same calculation logic across all the fields."

## Objective
Review and validate the daily probability/proportion calculation logic to ensure it's not introducing systematic errors that could affect correlation analysis.

## Tasks
- [ ] Review daily probability/proportion calculation code in condition_aggregated.py
- [ ] Validate calculation logic across all fields using same calculation approach
- [ ] Test for systematic calculation errors
- [ ] Verify that calculation logic is consistent across different metrics
- [ ] Document any findings or potential issues

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Daily proportion calculation logic thoroughly reviewed
- [ ] Calculation validation completed across all fields
- [ ] Systematic error testing completed
- [ ] Clear understanding of whether calculations are the source of correlations
- [ ] Documentation of findings and any issues discovered

## Dependencies
- Completion of baseline correlation analysis (Ticket 001)
- Completion of feed selection bias analysis (Ticket 002)

## Effort Estimate
1 week

## Implementation Notes
- User expects this is unlikely to be the source since same logic used across all fields
- Focus on systematic validation rather than deep investigation
- Document findings clearly for future reference
- This is more of a verification step than a primary investigation
