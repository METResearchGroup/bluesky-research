# Ticket 001: Baseline Correlation Analysis & Framework Implementation

**Linear Issue**: [MET-48](https://linear.app/metresearch/issue/MET-48/phase-1-implement-shared-correlation-analysis-framework)

## Research Question
"Look at the correlation of toxicity x constructiveness on all posts we have, to see if this is a trend that replicates across a wide sample of Bluesky posts."

## Objective
Implement the shared correlation analysis framework and conduct baseline correlation analysis across all Bluesky posts (20-30M posts) using Slurm processing.

## Tasks
- [ ] Create BaseCorrelationAnalyzer class with common utilities
- [ ] Implement configuration validation methods
- [ ] Add logging and data validation utilities
- [ ] Create correlation calculation methods (Pearson and Spearman)
- [ ] Integrate with existing shared modules in analytics system
- [ ] Design Slurm job for processing 20-30M posts
- [ ] Implement daily batch processing with garbage collection
- [ ] Create CSV output generation
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests for all utilities

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] BaseCorrelationAnalyzer class created with shared utility methods
- [ ] All tests pass with same outputs
- [ ] Integration with existing shared modules verified
- [ ] Configuration validation working correctly
- [ ] Correlation calculation methods implemented and tested
- [ ] Slurm job successfully processes all posts
- [ ] Daily batch processing with garbage collection working
- [ ] CSV output generation working correctly

## Dependencies
- Existing shared modules in analytics system
- Python 3.12+ environment
- Slurm cluster access

## Effort Estimate
2 weeks

## Implementation Notes
- This combines framework development with baseline analysis
- Focus on shipping quickly for research purposes
- Incorporate testing and documentation as we develop
- Daily batch processing is critical for memory management
