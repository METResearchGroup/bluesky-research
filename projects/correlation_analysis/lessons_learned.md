# Lessons Learned: Toxicity-Constructiveness Correlation Analysis

## Project Planning Insights

### What Worked Well
- **Structured Approach**: Following the PROJECT_PLANNING_EXECUTION_OUTLINE.md provided clear guidance for systematic project setup
- **Brain Dump Session**: Taking time for initial brainstorming helped clarify the 3 research questions and technical requirements
- **Specification Structure**: Using the 5-phase stakeholder-aligned approach from HOW_TO_WRITE_A_SPEC.md created comprehensive project definition
- **Research-Focused Design**: Aligning tickets with specific research questions rather than technical phases made the project more focused

### Process Improvements
- **Ticket Structure**: Combining framework development with baseline analysis in one ticket (MET-48) makes sense for research code where we need to ship quickly
- **Dependency Management**: Clear dependencies between phases (Phase 2 depends on Phase 1, Phase 3 depends on both) prevents implementation issues
- **Documentation Integration**: Incorporating testing and documentation into each ticket rather than separate phases aligns with research development practices

### Technical Insights
- **Memory Management**: Daily batch processing with garbage collection is critical for handling 20-30M posts
- **Slurm Integration**: Need to design jobs that can process entire datasets incrementally
- **Shared Module Integration**: Leveraging existing shared modules in analytics system is key to success
- **Implementation Structure**: Clear separation between planning (`projects/correlation_analysis/`) and implementation (`services/calculate_analytics/analyses/correlation_analysis_2025_08_24/`)

## Implementation Insights

### Phase 1 Success Factors ✅
- **Framework Design**: Creating a reusable BaseCorrelationAnalyzer class enabled quick implementation and testing
- **Memory Optimization**: Daily batch processing with garbage collection was essential for processing 18.4M posts without memory issues
- **Integration Strategy**: Leveraging existing shared modules in the analytics system significantly accelerated development
- **Research Focus**: Keeping the focus on answering the research question rather than building perfect infrastructure enabled rapid progress

### Phase 2 Success Factors ✅
- **Efficient Data Processing**: URI accumulation + single label loading approach was optimal for feed bias analysis
- **Condition-Specific Analysis**: Systematic investigation across all three feed algorithms provided comprehensive coverage
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Reusing correlation functions from Phase 1 ensured consistency and accelerated development
- **Research Validation**: Successfully ruling out algorithmic selection biases provided clear research conclusions

### Performance Surprises
- **Timeline**: Phase 1 completed in 2 days vs. 2 weeks planned - significantly outperformed expectations
- **Phase 2**: Completed in 1 day vs. 1 week planned - continued outperformance pattern
- **Overall Project**: Completed in 3 days vs. 4 weeks planned - exceptional efficiency
- **Data Processing**: Successfully processed 18.4M posts with optimized memory management
- **Correlation Results**: Confirmed expected negative correlation (-0.108 Pearson, -0.085 Spearman) validating the baseline relationship

### Technical Lessons
- **Batch Processing**: Daily batch processing with garbage collection is more effective than trying to process everything at once
- **Shared Modules**: Existing analytics system shared modules provided robust foundation for new analysis
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation and examples created during development paid off immediately
- **URI Accumulation Strategy**: Collecting lightweight URIs across all dates before loading heavy label data was optimal
- **Condition Mapping**: Efficient mapping of `uri : condition(s)` enabled systematic bias investigation

### Key Research Findings
- **Correlation Strength**: Both Pearson (-0.108) and Spearman (-0.085) correlations show consistent negative relationship
- **Statistical Significance**: Large sample size (18.4M) provides high confidence in correlation estimates
- **Baseline Established**: Phase 1 successfully establishes baseline for Phase 2 feed selection bias analysis
- **Bias Ruled Out**: Phase 2 successfully rules out algorithmic selection as source of correlations
