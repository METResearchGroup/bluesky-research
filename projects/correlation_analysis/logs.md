# Progress Log: Toxicity-Constructiveness Correlation Analysis

## Project Setup - 2025-08-24

### Initial Setup Completed
- [x] Brain dump session completed and documented
- [x] Comprehensive specification document created
- [x] Linear project MET-47 created with Northwestern team
- [x] 3 implementation tickets created and linked to project:
  - MET-48: Baseline Correlation Analysis & Framework Implementation
  - MET-49: Feed Selection Bias Analysis  
  - MET-50: Daily Proportion Calculation Logic Review
- [x] Project folder structure created following analytics system refactor spec
- [x] Ticket documentation files created
- [x] Project README and tracking files created

### Next Steps
- [ ] Begin implementation of Phase 1 (MET-48)
- [ ] Set up development environment with existing shared modules
- [ ] Start framework development and BaseCorrelationAnalyzer class

### Notes
- Project successfully follows analytics system refactor spec structure
- All 3 research questions clearly defined and mapped to tickets
- Dependencies properly established between phases
- Focus on shipping quickly for research purposes
- Integration with existing shared modules is key priority

## Implementation Phase 1 - TBD

## Implementation Phase 2 - TBD  
*To be populated as implementation begins*

## Implementation Phase 3 - TBD
