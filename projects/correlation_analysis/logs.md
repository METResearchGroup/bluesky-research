# Progress Log: Toxicity-Constructiveness Correlation Analysis

## Project Setup - 2025-08-24

### Initial Setup Completed
- [x] Brain dump session completed and documented
- [x] Comprehensive specification document created
- [x] Linear project MET-47 created with Northwestern team
- [x] 3 implementation tickets created and linked to project:
  - MET-48: Baseline Correlation Analysis & Framework Implementation
  - MET-49: Feed Selection Bias Analysis  
  - MET-50: Daily Proportion Calculation Logic Review
- [x] Project folder structure created following analytics system refactor spec
- [x] Ticket documentation files created
- [x] Project README and tracking files created

## Framework Implementation - 2025-08-24

### MET-48 Initial Framework Files Created
- [x] Created baseline_correlation_analysis.py with comprehensive docstring
- [x] Created feed_selection_bias_analysis.py with comprehensive docstring
- [x] Created daily_proportion_calculation_review.py with comprehensive docstring
- [x] Updated analyses README.md to reflect new structure

### GitHub Operations Completed
- [x] Created feature branch: feature/MET-48_correlation_analysis_framework
- [x] Committed all framework files with comprehensive docstrings
- [x] Pushed branch to remote repository
- [x] Created Pull Request #205: "(MET-48) Correlation Analysis Framework Files"
- [x] PR includes detailed description, Linear links, and completed subtasks

### PR Details
- **URL**: https://github.com/METResearchGroup/bluesky-research/pull/205
- **Status**: Open, needs review
- **Labels**: feature, needs-review
- **Files Added**: 4 new files with comprehensive documentation

### Next Steps
- [ ] Wait for PR review and approval
- [ ] Begin manual implementation of baseline correlation analysis logic
- [ ] Implement Slurm job design for large-scale processing
- [ ] Add actual correlation calculation methods and data processing logic

### Notes
- Project successfully follows analytics system refactor spec structure
- All 3 research questions clearly defined and mapped to tickets
- Dependencies properly established between phases
- Focus on shipping quickly for research purposes
- Integration with existing shared modules is key priority
