## Overview

Enhance and complete the SearchForm component with comprehensive testing, accessibility improvements, and UX enhancements. The component already exists but requires testing coverage, accessibility compliance, and integration with Headless UI components.

## Subtasks and Deliverables

| Subtask | Deliverable | Dependencies | Effort (hrs) | Priority Score | Linear Issue ID | Linear Issue Identifier | PR URL |
|---------|-------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|-----------------|------------------------|---------|
| Enhanced SearchForm Component | Improved component with Headless UI integration and accessibility | Project Foundation Setup | 4-6 | 14 | 4f935a22-2a01-4c4d-be76-245d4e5ee29b | MET-11 | TBD |
| Comprehensive Form Testing | Jest/RTL test suite with >90% coverage | Enhanced SearchForm Component | 6-8 | 13 | 4f935a22-2a01-4c4d-be76-245d4e5ee29b | MET-11 | TBD |
| Accessibility Audit & Fixes | WCAG AA compliant form with screen reader support | Enhanced SearchForm Component | 2-3 | 12 | 4f935a22-2a01-4c4d-be76-245d4e5ee29b | MET-11 | TBD |

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Component Enhancement (4-6 hours)
- Replace native date inputs with Headless UI DatePicker for better accessibility
- Implement proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- Add keyboard navigation support
- Enhance loading states and user feedback

### Phase 2: Testing Implementation (6-8 hours)
- Write comprehensive unit tests for all form behaviors
- Test form validation scenarios
- Test accessibility features with screen reader simulation
- Test responsive design across viewports
- Achieve >90% code coverage

### Phase 3: Accessibility Compliance (2-3 hours)
- Conduct accessibility audit using axe-core
- Fix any WCAG AA compliance issues
- Test with screen readers
- Validate keyboard navigation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All form inputs work correctly with proper validation
- [ ] Validation provides clear, accessible error messages
- [ ] Loading states prevent duplicate submissions
- [ ] Form is fully accessible (WCAG AA compliant)
- [ ] Uses React Hook Form and Headless UI components
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works throughout
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility verified

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood (1-5) | Impact (1-5) | Mitigation |
|------|------------------|--------------|------------|
| Headless UI date picker integration complexity | 3 | 4 | Use existing examples and documentation, fallback to enhanced native inputs |
| Accessibility compliance gaps | 2 | 4 | Use automated testing tools and manual verification |
| Test coverage challenges | 2 | 3 | Start with TDD approach, use RTL best practices |

## Dependencies

- Project Foundation Setup (MET-10) - âœ… Completed
- React Hook Form (already installed)
- Headless UI (already installed)
- Testing framework setup (already configured)

## Notes

- Current SearchForm component is functional but needs testing and accessibility improvements
- Focus on incremental enhancement rather than complete rewrite
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing usage
