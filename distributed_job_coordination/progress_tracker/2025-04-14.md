## Completed the Coordinator Class

Today I completed the core functionality of the Coordinator class, which serves as the central orchestration component of our distributed job coordination system. Key accomplishments include:

- Implemented robust state tracking using DynamoDB for job and task states
- Created dedicated `JobStateStore` and `TaskStateStore` classes in a new `dynamodb_utils.py` module
- Enhanced DynamoDB operations with proper error handling, verification, and atomic updates
- Connected state persistence to the Coordinator workflow
- Improved logging throughout the coordination process

The Coordinator now follows a complete workflow:

1. Job initialization and state creation
2. Data partitioning and batch preparation
3. State persistence to DynamoDB at critical points
4. Worker task dispatch and monitoring
5. Manifest generation and storage

This implementation ensures reliable job tracking across distributed components and provides a foundation for the monitoring and recovery capabilities needed for production workloads.

Next steps:
- Write comprehensive tests for the Coordinator
- Implement retry logic for failed tasks
- Complete the worker component for batch processing
- Add result aggregation functionality

The system is now architecturally complete with the Coordinator at its core, though testing remains to validate the implementation.
