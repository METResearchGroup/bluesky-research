# Social Network Analysis Tab Demo - Daily Task Tracking

## üìù Overview
This document tracks daily progress on the Streamlit Social Network Analysis (SNA) Tab Demo as defined in [2025_06_07_social_network_analysis_prd.md](../prd/2025_06_07_social_network_analysis_prd.md). The goal is to deliver a fully interactive, demo-ready SNA interface for social science research on polarization within 2 weeks. All implementation code will be developed in the new `search_engine/app_v2` directory and integrated as a new tab in the main app.

## üìã Task Checklist

### UI Components
- [x] [#001] Sidebar Controls (3 hrs)
  - [x] Dropdowns for Edge Type, Community Algorithm, Centrality Metric
  - [x] Sliders for Hop Depth, Time Range
  - [x] Checkbox groups for content filters: toxic/not toxic, valence (positive/neutral/negative), political (is/is not), political slant (left/center/right/unclear; only if political is True)
  - [x] Controls change preview and metrics
  - [x] Unit tests for controls and filter logic
  - [x] Split page: left = filters, right = chosen filters (deselectable)
  - [x] "Submit" button displays chosen parameters as a string

- [ ] [#002] Mini-Graph Preview (4 hrs)
  - [ ] Integrate networkx to render 50-node sample graph
  - [ ] Use Streamlit component (e.g., st.graphviz_chart or pyvis) for visualization
  - [ ] Graph updates when controls change
  - [ ] Unit tests for graph rendering and update logic

- [ ] [#003] Metric Summary Panel (3 hrs)
  - [ ] Display computed metrics: top 5 central nodes, community count, assortativity
  - [ ] Use static sample calculations tied to sample data
  - [ ] Metrics refresh on filter/parameter changes

- [ ] [#SNA-004] Export Simulation (2 hrs)
  - [ ] Buttons for "Download Edge List (CSV)", "Download Node Metrics (CSV)", "Download GEXF"
  - [ ] Simulate file with sample network data
  - [ ] Download triggers sample file

- [ ] [#SNA-005] Time Slider Animation (3 hrs)
  - [ ] Implement st.slider for date range; update graph and metrics accordingly
  - [ ] Sliding dates shows different pre-defined sample snapshots

### Static Assets & Data
- [ ] [#SNA-006] Prepare Sample Network Files (2 hrs)
  - [ ] Create .csv for nodes (political, valence, slant, toxicity) and edges (retweet, reply, like); 100 nodes/day for 2024-06-01 to 2024-06-14 (1,400 rows)
  - [ ] Bias sampling: positive valence/low toxicity ‚Üí more engagement; negative valence/high toxicity ‚Üí less engagement (verify trend with unit tests)
  - [ ] Python generator file with data quality checks; export as .csv
  - [ ] Load .csv for unit tests and simulation
  - [ ] Precompute centrality/community for snapshots
  - [ ] Files load and power UI components

- [ ] [#SNA-007] Define Sample Metrics (1 hr)
  - [ ] Hard-code centrality rankings and assortativity values for each snapshot
  - [ ] Metrics panel displays correct values per snapshot

### Integration & Documentation
- [ ] [#SNA-008] Layout & Styling (3 hrs)
  - [ ] Add tab layout: integrate SNA tab alongside Data Access tab
  - [ ] Ensure cohesive styling and navigation
  - [ ] SNA tab accessible and visually consistent

- [ ] [#SNA-009] Onboarding & Help (2 hrs)
  - [ ] Tooltips explaining SNA concepts (centrality, community)
  - [ ] "How to Use" collapsible help section
  - [ ] Help elements appear contextually

- [ ] [#SNA-010] README & Demo Instructions (2 hrs)
  - [ ] Write instructions for running demo and navigating SNA tab
  - [ ] Include sample research questions and flow script
  - [ ] Stakeholders can launch and demo without assistance

## üìù Progress Notes

### Day 1 (2025-06-13)
- [#001] Sidebar Controls fully implemented and tested.
  - All dropdowns (Edge Type, Community Algorithm, Centrality Metric), sliders (Hop Depth, Time Range), and checkbox groups (Toxic, Not Toxic, Valence, Political, Not Political, Slant) are present and functional.
  - Selected filters are displayed as chips, and the UI allows for future deselection logic.
  - The "Submit" button displays a string summary of the chosen parameters.
  - All state is managed in a modular, typed way, and the panel is integrated into the SNA tab with a two-column layout.
  - Unit tests for sidebar controls render and logic are passing.
  - All acceptance criteria for #001 are met.
- Next: Begin Mini-Graph Preview (#002)
