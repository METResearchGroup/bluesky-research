# Social Network Analysis Tab Demo - Daily Task Tracking

## üìù Overview
This document tracks daily progress on the Streamlit Social Network Analysis (SNA) Tab Demo as defined in [2025_06_07_social_network_analysis_prd.md](../prd/2025_06_07_social_network_analysis_prd.md). The goal is to deliver a fully interactive, demo-ready SNA interface for social science research on polarization within 2 weeks. All implementation code will be developed in the new `search_engine/app_v2` directory and integrated as a new tab in the main app.

  sample data, load the .csv file for the sample data, add those necessary fields, and then export that .csv file again. The goal is to have 1 single sample data file and to have all components read from that file.

  - [x] Include sample research questions and flow script
  - [x] Stakeholders can launch and demo without assistance
  - [x] Make all of this available in a collapsible section called "Demo instructions"

## üìù Progress Notes

### Day 1 (2025-06-08)

- [#001] Sidebar Controls fully implemented and tested.
  - All dropdowns (Edge Type, Community Algorithm, Centrality Metric), sliders (Hop Depth, Time Range), and checkbox groups (Toxic, Not Toxic, Valence, Political, Not Political, Slant) are present and functional.
  - Selected filters are displayed as chips, and the UI allows for future deselection logic.
  - The "Submit" button displays a string summary of the chosen parameters.
  - All state is managed in a modular, typed way, and the panel is integrated into the SNA tab with a two-column layout.
  - Unit tests for sidebar controls render and logic are passing.
  - All acceptance criteria for #001 are met.
- [#002] Mini-Graph Preview fully implemented and tested.
  - The mini-graph now uses pyvis for interactive, browser-based visualization.
  - The network structure consists of two dense clusters with 4‚Äì5 broker nodes connecting them, visually representing high homophily and broker roles.
  - Node labels are hidden by default; user names appear as tooltips on hover for clarity and compactness.
  - The visualization is visually appealing, compact, and fits well in the UI.
  - All error handling and integration issues (JSON options, pyvis compatibility) have been resolved.
  - Unit tests for graph rendering and update logic are passing.
  - All acceptance criteria for #002 are met.
- [#003] Metric Summary Panel fully implemented and tested.
  - The Metric Summary Panel is now available in the SNA tab, displaying the top 5 central nodes (by degree), community count, and assortativity for the current graph snapshot.
  - Metrics are computed using static calculations on the sample graph and update live when the graph or filter state changes.
  - Comprehensive TDD was followed: tests were written first, confirmed to fail, then the panel was implemented and the tests now pass.
  - The panel is visually integrated with the mini-graph and matches the UI/UX standards of the app.
  - All acceptance criteria for #003 are met.
- [#004] Export Simulation fully implemented and tested.
  - The Export Simulation panel is now available in the SNA tab, providing buttons to download the edge list (CSV), node metrics (CSV), and the full network (GEXF) for the current sample graph.
  - Each button generates and serves a sample file using the current graph snapshot, matching the UI/UX and data standards of the app.
  - Comprehensive TDD was followed: tests were written first, confirmed to fail, then the panel was implemented and the tests now pass.
  - The panel is visually integrated with the mini-graph and metric summary, and all acceptance criteria for #004 are met.
- [#005] Time Slider Animation fully implemented and tested.
  - The Time Slider Animation panel is now available in the SNA tab, providing a date range slider (2024-06-01 to 2024-06-14) that updates the state and is ready to drive graph and metric updates.
  - The slider is integrated at the top of the SNA panel, and its value is accessible to all downstream components for snapshot switching.

  - Unit tests verify schema, engagement bias, and data quality, and all tests pass.
  - The files are ready to power UI components and further analysis.
- [#007] Interface unification and optimization complete.
  - All SNA components now use a single, unified sample data loader and reflect the same filtered data.
  - Persistent HTML caching is implemented for the mini-graph visualization, with cache files stored in `graph_cache/` for reuse across sessions.
  - Subgraphing is implemented: for large graphs, only the largest connected component or a random sample of 100 nodes is visualized, ensuring fast rendering and smooth animation.
  - The UI clearly indicates when a subgraph is shown, and the cache is persistent across Streamlit restarts.
  - All relevant tests pass, and the SNA tab is performant and robust.
- [#008] Layout & Styling fully implemented and tested.
  - The SNA tab now features a visually cohesive, well-aligned layout, consistent with the rest of the app.
